1,"            Hive engineer failed to show twice after I had taken two days off work to get hive installed. British Gas employees wouldn’t give a monkeys,I suppose it’s the shareholders that are suffering . Because of the engineer not showing up twice I decided to cancel my boiler care and appliance cover with them as well as cancel this hive contract so a sum of about £110 a month lost. I will give my money to someone who wants it. Honestly you guys were great a few years back, but now you are mediocre at best. What the hell has happened to you.

1,"            I moved from SSE to British Gas because SSE were so useless about getting a Smart meter fitted. I booked an appointment for the same from British Gas (it was actually part of their Terms and Conditions to have one fitted). I booked time off and stayed in, after and hour or so after the booked time I rang them, they had no record of the appointment. What kind of company is unable to use a computer to book appointments into a calendar? Not one for me.

1,"            There engineers  were rude and surely.3 times I had to get them back for a job not done correctly. I think that peeveee them and it showed in there attitude.Engineers there are unaccountable  otherwise how could they get away with this poor customer service. They must remember YOU invite  them into you're home and should show  respect!!

1,"            Firstly the App never works and the people you ring up to help have the same ""reload it onto your device"" instructions. Absolutely rubbish. Booked a service I had to wait 2months for, took the morning off work as the engineer was coming between 8am and 1pm. At 12.50 I get a phone call saying he won't be there till 3.30pm. What's the point if you can't even get to an appointment that has been booked 2 months in advance. I was also told I could book the appointment anytime including weekends when I bought the product, when I went to book the service for the insurance product I was told this was not true. Communication and management in this company is horrific.

1,"            Conned me left right and centre. Been with them for 14 years, soon as I told them I am changing suppliers things started to go wrong. They didn't care about the 14 year relationship and now I will never ever in the future do business with them.

5,"            Yesterday an engineer called Darren visited our house to check things out for our Home Cover.  He was brilliant - courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, and full of useful suggestions.  If every engineer turned up like he did, BG would be in a great place!  Having used Scottish Power in the past, this was a HUGE improvement.  Darren works in the East Midlands region

1,"            I am appalled with the customer service I just received from British Gas contact centre. I just received a letter stating that my bill is now doubled from what it use to be. Called British Gas to discuss this and the lady who introduced herself as Asha (from what I could understand) was extremely rude, with no empathy no customer service skills whatsoever. I have never been so disrespected this much, from the moment she picked the call she spoke like she didn’t even want to be speaking to me then when I said I can’t afford to be paying double what I use to pay and if there was any chance the monthly payment can be reduced,  she instantly got rude, I said to her to you can’t be speaking to customers this way, she then turned around and hang up the phone on me. I am in shock, disappointed and completely appalled.

5,"            Yes British Gas is far from the cheapest but my household has been with them over 20 years even though the householder is on a very low income. We believe in quality over expense and I can say we've never had to phone BG about anything, never been a problem to speak of and the bill payer in the house is very happy about being in the vulnerable group as it makes them feel valued as a customer. We're happy to pay what we're paying for the great service we are provided

1,"            The worst company ever, everything they do is unprofessional! If I would have the option to give a review without a star. I would be really glad! The engineers, first of all, are incapable to do anything. I'm not happy at all with this service and the company should be closed! I'm wasting my time so badly with these incompetents.

1,"            A customer of BG for over 20 years, I changed supplier to the Peoples Energy Company because of the continual poor customer service and continuing price rises. My big gripe with them is the speed with which they send final bills to debt collection agencies. I contacted them to arrange a payment plan for the final bills. They were happy to take a payment and then informed me that they couldn't set up a payment plan because the final bills were in the process of being handed over to a debt collection agency. This was less than ONE MONTH after receiving the final bill. They refused to cancel the DCA but still took the money out of my account. Bloody awful service from someone willing to pay a debt. NEVER USE BRITISH GAS

1,"            Disgraceful.  Told them we did not need them to install new boiler over a month in advance as we had received a cheaper quotation.  They still thought they were doing so up until 1 working day before the date as no one logged the cancellation.  Then they sent us Debt Collection letters for a detector invoice that had been paid over 5 weeks previous.  Promised the matter was dealt with and then proceeded to send yet another letter.  British Gas you have lost me as a customer after many years.  I've had enough of your administrative and customer service incompetence.

1,"            Considering British Gas is supposed to be the biggest energy company in the UK they are certainly the worst for pricing, misleading and customer services. They really could not care less about their customers. They are not interested in your complaints and just want to get rid of you when you are on the phone to them. I read that they lost over 500.000 customers this year, well I'm not surprised, stay away at all costs and go with a lesser known energy supplier. British Gas shame on you.

1,"            have had nothing but problems from British Gas and they have repetitively failed to respond to correspondence and complaint. Although the major issue was a simple one of putting my disabled mother in law onto a correct residential account rather than the business account BG decided to use, this took nearly a year to fix and included numerous threatening letters which BG said we should ignore because they couldn't stop the computer generating them. They are still creating problems and failing to correct them. We are of course moving supplier.

5,"            I had to call customer services regarding a high bill received by an elderly person and he was worried about it the really pleasant and helpful advisor helped sort it out and also advised about the warm home discount for the elderly which he can apply for in September.

1,"            If I could give British Gas no stars I would do so... Just got off the phone from a male 'customer service agent' - I use the term advisedly, as I am unemployed again, and have an electricity  bill of £144.59 , which I said I could completely clear in September... by the way part of this bill is £13.00 administration charge, which they won't take off, because looking at my account I have had other late charges over the years ( all bills paid off previously in full) so I don't know what they are complaining about.... Going to OffGem about their cavalier attitude. Completely twisting my conversations around, so they can tie me up in knots... it didn't work...

1,"            Just avoid them.  Homecare costs increased this year by nearly 25%, but takes 3 months to get a service appointment.  They even charged the £99 excess for a repair that should not have been necessary if the work had been done properly less than a year before.

1,"            The worse of the top 6 suppliers. Rubbish customer service, rubbish services and over priced energy.  Had to make two complaints within 12 months due to the poor service, incorrect billing, allowing me to have a tariff that required a smart meter which I didn't have it took them 6 months to realize their error. And the best part is awarding me compensation for their crap service and forgetting to add it to my account. I got it 12 months later, along with the compensation for the second complaint. They couldn't explain why my billing switch from 1/4 to 1/2 yearly who wants to be billed every 6 months. Then sent out an email to say they are increasing my direct debit to £334.00 per month. REALLY british gas!!! And they are quick to record activity on your credit file. Just paid of my balance and move to a different supplier. Never again will I have any dealings with these scum bags.

1,"            Awful! I moved into a new property and found the key meter had been bypassed. I rung British Gas as it was there meter that had been bypassed. They sent out a revenue protection officer and an engineer who then turned up, took the meter and totally disconnected my electricity leaving me with none. Then left. I recommend if you ever come across this dont call British Gas. Rinse them for whatever you can.

1,"            I have been with them for about 10 years now. Since the last two years their service has been getting worse day by day.You will not get an appointment straight away, minimum wait 5 days. When you get an appointment the wait time is 6 hours. For people like me who work 8.30 to 5.30, it is just not possible to sit in and wait for 6 hours therefore have to request friends to sit in. When the engineers most of the time they need a second visit either for parts or you yourself have to book a second visit as the job has not been done properly.The second appointment wait time is even longer than the first one.Last year my fridge broke down, they took 4 weeks to work out what was needed to done, ordering wrong parts, not fixing it properly. It was the week when there was heat way. I have two boys and a diabetic mum. I struggled to keep up with the food needs of the family members during that time. It cost me a huge amount of money too as the food had to be thrown away on daily basis. I spent more money on food then I could have spent to buy a new fridge freezer!! I did not buy a new one as they kept on saying this will be fixed in two days in four days, without giving a fixed time period. Everytime you make a complain they will offer you £30 TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I have suggested so many times that instead of offering customers money spend this on hiring competitive engineers and more of them to fulfill the needs of the customers.My fridge is again having problems, when asked to give priority they said someone can come and visit in the 6 hour slot in three days time!!!! Ridiculous!! In this heat you wait for 3 days and take half a day unpaid leave too! This time I will take it to the highest level of complain.My washing machine was not working about 4 weeks ago, they sent an engineer who fixed it in 20 minutes and said it is good as gold, it had the same problem the next day when it was turned on.I wouldn't have wasted even one star on them!!!!!

We had been moved in for 2 weeks before starting the renovation so all gas was disconnected which it still is. I have now received a bill for £740 pounds which we couldn't quite believe. After speaking to someone at there call centre have been told that we must pay it then they'll refund it back or it'll be passed on to a debt collection agency which I find disgusting to be threatened by such a big company and have to be paying for their balls up!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY...

1,"            - Giving you a time slot of 5 hours is impossible to organise for access- Company promised a fix time for appointment but professional called that he will need to attend earlier as he is 'keen on going home early as it is his last job of the day'. Not exactly professional, as it is their job to complete the job when its been promised for a fix time.Ridiculous service. Have worked with the company more than once and I definitely would not recommend unless you have all day to lay around your house and wait.Good service on the phone however.

1,"            Summary- Appalling Customer Service - Was advised different things every time I called and they wouldn’t rectify their mistakes- My complaint handler was useless and sounded like he didn’t even want to actually help- Advised that I needed to separate electric meters for business and domestic and apparently there was no other way, for some magical reason other suppliers said they can use 1 which saved me £1000+ (costs a lot to get meters installed or changed).- Currently switching suppliers, I will never be going with British Gas again and I recommend you don’t either, there’s a reason they have so many bad reviews.Detailed ExplanationMy biggest problem with British Gas is being advised wrong multiple times, it was as though the employees had no idea what was going on.(May 2018) I have a business with a flat above, I was on pay as you go and wanted to switch to business. Advisor 1 said first you need to upgrade to smart meters before you can be upgraded to business. I said ok, 1 month later the smart meters were fitted.I called back to upgrade to business, Advisor 2 said you need credit meters not smart meters. I spent 1 month on ‘out of contract’ rates paying a lot more for my electric for the wrong meters to be installed! Advisor 2 runs credit check in order to install credit meters, credit check fails for some reason. Advisor 2 says check on Experian if you have a good score then call us back.Experian score is perfectly fine as expected because this is the first time I was turned down. I call back and Advisor 3 says a credit check should never have run. I’m a patient guy but at this point I was getting annoyed. Advisor 3 says you’re a business you should be straight on a business contract but he doesn’t know the full details so he checks with someone from business. I ask about the credit check that never should have been done in the first place, he says and I quote “British Gas can have that removed after a week” I thought well that’s fine. He puts me through to business side as “they know more about this”. As soon I was put through I said “I hope you can help me out here as everyone else keeps putting me through to someone else”. Turns out he couldn’t do anything either as I was not a business account, and he put me through to a complaint handler.(Friday 15th June 2018) Now the Complaint Handler was the last straw for me. They had some kind of specialist on the line as well which I wouldn’t be surprised was a legal person to protect them. My complaint handler was useless, every time I asked something he’d say he knew nothing about and couldn’t comment. I told him I was told the wrong advice by so many people but of course he didn’t care. I told him about the credit check and what Advisor 3 said to me, however he says British Gas can’t do anything about it, at this point I’d ran out of patience. The complaint handler advised something completely different, I’d need to have 2 separate electric meters for business and domestic and that British Gas can’t do it any other way. He gave me contact details for Northern Power-grid, advised me to call them and get another meter installed and then call British Gas back.  He also said he’d listen to the calls and see what happened but wouldn’t be able to tell me what action or if any action had been taken against the previous advisors, he said he’d call by Tuesday 19th June 2018. It gets to Tuesday and he calls and says he was busy and didn’t listen to any calls, said he’d call me back on Friday. At this rate I was still paying for ‘out of contract’ rates and I had enough of British Gas’ BS, told him I’m not bothered anymore I’m leaving British Gas. I had enough of being told the wrong things and my complaint handlers attitude and efficiency was appalling. Instead of working with me it was like he was working against me. A credit was run and judging by the advice of the complaint handler and advisor 3 it shouldn’t have been done as I should have been told I need 2 meters by the first advisor. British Gas said they would not rectify their mistake. This also confirmed that all the previous advisors told me the wrong things as the complaint handler was advising me completely differently. I wasn’t sure who to trust at British Gas so I went to another supplier who had much simpler methods of doing things.I’d like to point out having another meter installed would have cost me around £1000 and the complaint handler said it was a MUST. I checked with multiple other supplier who all said they can use that 1 meter but for some magical reason British Gas couldn’t.

1,"            My radiator sprang a leak, spraying pressurised water over the floor. The very unhelpful call handler told me that despite being around 11am that the repairer wouldn't come until after 5pm.When the engineer turned up and fixed the problem, he told me that BG hadn't classified my problem as an emergency and he had done several other jobs locally that weren't a priority and he would have come to me if he had known.I complained to British Gas who, conveniently, said that their call system was broken and it only recorded what I said and not what the call handler said thus avoiding any liability - but I'm sure this was just accidental, wasn't it?They also pointed out that in their Terms and Conditions it says they will only attend as soon as they can. So, that means they could take days to attend if they like and you have no comeback. I don't think this is ethical nor reasonable. You decide.

They had been underestimating my account for 3 years. I wasn't given a choice about a payment plan it was all just taken in one go.

1,"            I moved into my property to find that there is a pre payment electric meter over 7 feet high . I have arthritis and cannot climb a ladder. I also can t get to the nearest venue to top up my key as I can only walk about 100 yds. Spent hours on the phone but despite many promises i can't get an engineer to change the meter to quarterly payment or even have it lowered on the wall so I can reach. I have been with brit. Gas since I was 18. I'm now 64 and I have never missed paying a bill in all that time. Only way I can get electric is give a neighbour or stranger my debit card and pin to get key topped up. Very unsafe. So is wobbling about on a ladder which I find very frightening. An engineer has now called but wouldn't touch the electric meter. Instead he has changed the gas meter to a card. (I didn't owe any money) To compound matters he has actually capped off the gas saying I have to get a safety certificate on the boiler every year , even though I own my home and he said the boiler works fine. The only problem was a missing knob on the programmer which has been resolved in a few minutes by my neighbour who is electrician. Gas Engineer was very rude and said if i didn't sign his fault sheet he would have all my gas pipes in the road removed and I would have to pay for the work.Have spent in excess of 4 hours on the phone but just get passed around from one advisor to another with waits of up to 30 mins listening to stupid music. At my wits end. Looks like I will have no heating this winter and likely periods of no electricity too.

We had an excellent engineer who certainly knew what he was doing on top of that he was respectful, informative, wore shoe covers and cleaned up each area.He was young & although our appliances are 8 & 12 years old he didn't need manuals (as has always been the case in the past) he was familiar with them and clearly knew his job.Having read some of the Reviews we were quite worried, this was totally unfounded. He wasn't a subcontractor, he was an employee.

1,"            I am sad to say this but I have been with them for years but my latest experience re a boiler  has convinced me to move supplier and take action to sue for breach of contract under Home serve agreement  I have sent several emails requesting them to deal with a complaint over the past few months explaining that sometimes without hot water since a new part was fitted after much delay and some compensation  I have had no acknowledgement or reply to my  emails or follow up to any of my telephone calls Initially I was referred by them to Hive and after a prompt and helpful email  exchange it was discovered it was not one of their machines and I should not have been referred there. I give Hive this that when they found out what has happened they have regularly followed up to ask if British Gas has resolved the matter I have said no and they appear to be aghast at British gas not having responded to the  emails I have sent them   I have sent a further email tonight but don't expect a reply as per normal . Ultimately it will be their loss as by switching provider they will be losing several thousand of pound  per annum being  the usual  bills they would have rendered My advice to anyone is steer clear of this Company they clearly have no customer care and try to deal with customers by ignoring them Nick M

British Gas then decided to change the bills to my company even when we didnt own the property, got all this credited back and advised them that the meter they were billing was not on this site. Still they keep billing me, photos of meters sent, no reply, again call this morning asking when are we going to pay, Simple answer is we are not! Time to send a letter to the ombudsman i think!

That has been fixed after redoing my bills for the previous 9 months (they did give £30 compensation as I had spent about 5 hours on the phone to get it fixed). Now they have put a new thing on their website called Monthly Comparison With Previous Years. Great I thought for those of us that want and have to keep a close eye on our bills. But disappointment again as it is now June 11th and June still didn't appear on the new comparison.

I booked at date and stayed at home for the engineer. He arrived in good time and he asked to see my existing meters. As soon as he saw my meter box, he knew the new meter would not fit, apologised and left. I'm not sure why the original service engineer didn't check and I have no idea why British Gas did not ask me to measure my meter box to check it would fit. What they did instead is wasted a journey by one of their engineers and wasted my morning waiting in.

Only then within 2 weeks of paying hundreds of pounds which I was sure was incorrect, they set up a direct debit again with much higher payments than all the time I’ve been with them. None of the amounts add up and when I asked them to explain the massive increase in what I’m paying (which is on a fixed price till July) they’ve provided no response. Daylight robbery.  I’ve complained and heard nothing back regarding the price hike. Their online form doesn’t work and only gives error messages so you can’t ever submit a complaint, and their chat system is useless.

Surprise surprise they called and cancelled during the slot while I was waiting for them to come and didn't have another appointment until April. Meanwhile we did some investigation into the boiler we had which is 15 years old and never serviced and decided to get some quotes for a new one. Don't want to get caught out in winter with a baby due in October. 2 days before the April appointment they called to cancel because snow was forcast but unsurprisingly their sales guy could still make the appointment, I went online and it let me rebook the appointment for the next day as no snow turned up but again they cancel. This time I did atleast get  £60 back but still not good enough. Finally my boiler was serviced a week ago, however less than a week later it no longer works. I've phoned them to say it doesn't work and I have no heating or hot water and they don't care. All the have is the 'computer says attitude' so with a 2 year old and being pregnant I'm being told to lug a kettle of hot water around to wash when needed until they can get out to me in 2 days time.  That is if they don't cancel again...I've had homecare for 8 years used to be great, now it's appalling I think I'll just save the £50 a month I pay in future to pay a local person to fix the issue.

To be fair to them, every person I've spoken to has been very helpful, it's just frustrating that no one seems to understand what's actually going on. There seems to be an issue with my Order Purchase Number, as it still hasn't been completed and is thus making it impossible for me to have full access to my account. The last person I spoke to has said he's passed on the information to the back office, and should be dealt with in 5 working days. I hope that's true.

Automated system took forever and then offered me just one appointment time. I spoke to an agent, who also offered me just one date, two months in the future. I explained that my service was due now, and it was their fault it hadn't been booked as they didn't write to me as promised. No apology. No other date offered. 'Nothing we can do.'Made the appointment and was told I would get a text to confirm. I didn't.Two months later, and 36 hrs before the appointment, B Gas rang to cancel. I refused to accept their cancellation, as I had arranged to take a day off work, and insisted on speaking to a manager. 'They won't be able to do anything for you.' I persisted. A manager eventually spoke to me and immediately told me they couldn't do anything. I reminded them that I was a customer, with a service contract, and they had to uphold the terms of that contract. 'We can't keep the appointment as we don't have enough engineers.' I pointed out that this had happened in the previous year. 'There's nothing we can do.'I asked when my appointment would be moved to - two months' time. That was four months after the due date and completely unacceptable.Their whole attitude was one of bored indifference, and a complete unwillingness to sympathise, empathise, or be at all flexible.As a result of their attitude and sheer incompetence, I cancelled my contract and arranged for a local gas servicing company to take over. They were able to make an appointment for two weeks' time, and I have dealt with them previously and they are polite, courteous, efficient, flexible and customer-focused.

1,"            I left this wretched company a month ago now and feel that its time to expose them. British gas services is all about sales, sales, sales they do not care about the customers. Staff are constantly monitored and pressure to sale to customers even elderly, vulnerable. I have had to do sales with very elderly customers (80 plus) when I tell my manager I dont think the customer fully understands what I'm selling to them or the terms and conditions they will tell you to carry on ""as long as they are saying hmm or yes when youre reading it"". We are forced to promote to everyone unless its a complaint call so if you hear them say ""I can see you have cover for xyz what would you do if you had a breakdown on xyz"" thats the most common sales tactic. Everyone's sales are put on the board and e-mailed to everyone so there is a pressure to target all customers including vulnarable and elderly customers. Thats why if you missed a payment or something happened to your agreement the agent is more than happy to cancel your cover down and set it up again as it means a sale for them. So homecare 1=1 sale. Homecare 2=2 sales. Homecare 3-2 sales and homecare 4=3 sales. This is why agents are also so eager to keep calling you to set up cover.Considering the majority of out customers are over 70 (we even get a few over 90) its shameful that were constantly targeting them most of these customers only want a boiler service but we are forced to bombard them with extra cover and then prices ALWAYS go up after renewal most elderly people are happy to pay and wont question the change, some of them often forget if they even paid the year before so dont even realise that the price has gone up so much. If you have an elderly family member check up on them an keep track of how much their paying. Call in when you are with them and ask to be added as a nominee/representative on the account, keep track of their renewal so BG isnt leeching off their pension.Now lets get into appointments-we can only offer 2 hour appointments in particular circumstances so please stop harrasing agents its not their fault these are the rules. Appts are eith 8-1 or 12-6pm. We will add your contact number to the appointment but alooooooot of engineers dont even bother to call and will barely knock then leave a card. Again who ever you speak to in the call centre...this isnt their fault. Many engineers simply cant be bothered and if this happens to you request for the agent to raise your complaint to the engineers service manager-I had instances where the service manager would arrange for someone to come back to the house ASAP. There is only so much we can do in the call centre as there so many different departments and if they say they cant have somebody back out thats literally it we just have to be the bearer of bad news.If you are a landlord and booking a gas safety check make sure the person puts AS-INS-LI at the top of the appointment. We use job codes to book appointments so for a service it would be AS-CHB-CNI1/CNI2. The most common reason for landlords not getting the CP12 on time if because the person booking didnt put the job code correctly. CP12s cannot be produced in the call centre!!!!! it had to go to the landlords admin, they do not have a number you can call.... If you complain and start asking to speak to a manager you are wasting your time, there is nothing anyone in the contact centre can do if the administrative havent produced the CP12 you will spend half an hour of your time arguing and shouting at managers and thats all it will be -you wasting half an hour of your life arguing and shouting. It can normally take 7 working days for you to receive the CP12 once its raised to landlords admin. Most ASV appointments are about 2 months away from you calling unless you live in a big city like glasgow or london. If you live in a village/small city make sure you call 2 months in advance of when you ant the appointment. ALOT of service appointments get cancelled because British gas doesnt have the resources. They are happy to sell to you but cant get enough engineers to actually serve you for what you pay for. They constantly reschedule appointments-often on the day and often without calling the customer. So when you call into the call centre the person youre speaking to will have to be subjected to your frustration when its a completely different department that do this and customers arent allowed to speak to them. You see how this company operates? They want customer service agents to take all the abuse from customers for issues that are 99% of the time not their fault. In a year working there only 1 complaint was actually my fault. Most customers are angry about issues beyond that agents control. Oh and did I mention agents get penalised for making outbound calls?? Yes this is part of the ""stats"" that they put out which is why you might have been promised a call back but didnt get it or when a call gets disconnect they wont call you back. Even when a call back is arranged you can only call once thats it. Also if youre chasing up an engineer and the agent tells you to just wait or engineer will be there its because they will be penalised for trying to call different departments/engineers so they will try avoid doing this. Also the same reason agents prefer to transfer you straight through to another department as they get penalised for waiting on hold with you to get through to that department even though this can make the difference between putting you to the right/wrong person as BG have so many damn departments. British gas literally penalise their call centre agents for trying to do the right thing. I mean if a customer spent 30mins in a que to get through and the call cuts off you would think ringing them back would be the right thing right? or if they have had appointments cancelled and their calling to make sure it goes ahead surely it would be best to call the engineer or dispatch to ensure this right but noo the agent will get done for it. Get pulled to the side by managers for making too many outbound calls or spending too long on hold to get through to other departments.

3,"            We had a British Gas guy round yesterday to give us a quote for a new boiler. He did mention on leaving that we would get a message from British Gas asking us to review our overall experience. However, the questions they ask for the review is not balanced and therefore I cannot answer the 3 questions they ask with a simple “yes or no” as it needs to be broken down more. Firstly, would I recommend them to a friend. Simple answer No. purely because of their charges. We found the identical boiler and associated parts online for £200 less than their quote - and this was from a smaller plumbing company who would not have the purchasing power of British Gas! Also installation costs were greatly over-inflated. We could knock another £500 off installation costs and that included warranty on both the boiler and the installation. So straight away there was an £700 saving on a £3,700 quote! Now, the guy who came out to us, Paul, could not have been a nicer guy. He wasn’t high pressure sales, he did a complete and thorough assessment of our heating system and did not try to sell us the most expensive product. He was fair, honest and a very nice chap and obviously extremely knowledgeable about his product/trade. I would score him 10/10. Good guy, good product, but grossly over-inflated prices. Sorry BG you only get a 3 star and that is purely because of your outstanding representative Paul.

1,"            Changed two months ago from British gas domestic to British Gas business. Same company, same meter so what could possibly go wrong? A reading from a meter that is not on this site and an absolute refusal to accept the meter they are ""reading"" does not exist.  Endless calls to South African so-called customer service departments who make numerous promises to call back but do not. Say I cannot cancel the contract. I think I can. The contract was for reading and billing through meter that is on site, not an imaginary meter dreamt up by the anonymous meter reader. My contract with British Gas was for the real world and not some alternative reality where invisible meters live.

After fixing it on the 2nd callout the engineer said he wants to check my boiler. After checking it he said your boiler is in fit to operate and I need to change the boiler.  I pointed to him it can be fixed. After a lengthy debate he agreed. He said it's 10 year old boiler and you can't get the parts. I said you can and showed him. He order the parts after about 3 week came with the parts to fix removed everything and and said we need another part. I asked him to put it back he said sorry I can't. You have to wait till we get the parts. Or you can get a new boiler. The engineer is very incompetent. After chatting with many others they have similar stories. Avoid British gas home service.

1,"            Wildly overpriced, and a very poor experience. If I try to use the app, it locks me out of my account automatically. It also doesn't record meter readings I submit, and the estimates end up completely off the charts.e.g. They've just bumped our bills up (for a small, well-insulated 2-bed flat that we haven't heated in two months) to a minimum £135 a month. And despite having paid £95 a month for the last six months, our account is apparently £350 in debt? All because these 'meter reading estimates' show us using the equivalent of usage for a six-bed family house. I've enquired about these estimates before and been told that 'actual usage was above what even BG forecasted'. But surely these are BG estimates if they didn't receive my meter readings?I tried to log in to view the breakdown of this latest bill, and the website crashed repeatedly. So I can't even see where this charge is coming from. That's enough for me. Submitted a transfer to Bulb this morning. It's the end of an era for British Gas, I think.**Update: had to take my complaint to Twitter in the end, as the website wouldn't accept contact and I can't call from work. They jumped on it at first, but are now ignoring me without having answered any of my questions. Can see many similar complaints, that they disappear after trying to smooth over public perception. Just... stay away. Really. Let them disappear into extinction - ideally without your money.

(You can see where this is going, can't you, and I'm still kicking myself I fell for it). The guy comes out on Monday (1st day off work), and gives us a ridiculously inflated quote, which even with the 700 'discount', was still at least 200 pounds dearer than any of the subsequent quotes we've had. I phoned BG on Monday after he'd been, saying we weren't going for the quote, and asking them to send another engineer out to fix it. I told them that the first guy hadn't had the part on his van, and to make sure the second engineer had it when he came. Second engineer out today, 2nd afternoon off work, he doesn't have the part with him. Says there's no way to pass a message on from one engineer to another via the call centre. Says he'll have to order the part and come back tomorrow. (3rd afternoon off work)Shower of amateurish, unprofessional, badly organised cockwombles.

1,"            Terrible company, possibly the most disorganised and clueless I've dealt with. The first time they kept sending bills for the wrong meter despite constantly informing them and proving that it wasn't my supply. They also wouldn't accept payment for the meter/supply that I was responsible for. Then they forgot about me altogether and I had to remind them to bill me for about a year of supply when I moved out (tempting to try and get away with it and probably would have, given their cluelessness - but too honest for my own good).Second property where they were the default suppliers, they had me on an expensive business account and refused to change it. This even though it was a semi-detached new build residential property in a sleepy suburb which had never been used for business purposes (brand new!). Idiots.I've switched, obviously.

2,"            We have been using British gas to service our central heating boiler for many years. Initially, it worked well, we made an appointment and they turned up and did a good job. Then about 3 years ago, the engineer turned up, did a thorough inspection and came back the next day to fit several new parts. However, the boiler was still not working properly and we called the service department again. They sent out 2 engineers, explaining that the 2nd was there to train on our type of warm air boiler. When they checked the earlier work, they advised me that the nuts securing one of the new components were only finger tight and had not been properly secured. They secured it and the problem was solved. Subsequently my partner and I have been obliged to spend lengthy periods out of the country and arranging service visits has therefore become more complicated. Last year I booked an overdue service and agreed a morning time slot. When no-one had called within an hour of the end of the time slot, I telephoned to find out what was happening and was told they had cancelled my appointment! No-one could come out to me because they were dealing with an emergency, but if I rebooked they would give me a 2 hour slot rather than a 4 hour slot. Last week I rebooked the now seriously overdue service, but could not book a 2 hour slot on the website so had to call British Gas. After going through their recorded messages a few times, I eventually spoke to someone, who tried to give me a 6 hour time slot! I reminded him that I was promised a 2 hour slot and he gave me the 12 til 2 pm slot today (14th May). At about 1:00pm I received a call to say the engineer was detained on an earlier appointment, but would be with me shortly after 2pm. No-one turned up. I waited 45 minutes and rang to find out when I could expect to see the engineer. Again I went through the recorded stuff at great length, but eventually spoke to a young woman, who told me she could tell me when the engineer would get to me, as they were probably dealing with an emergency, which could be a danger to life and limb.. I asked her how she knew that my boiler was not a danger to life and limb, as they had failed to meet their commitment to service it twice in succession... I asked to speak to her supervisor who eventually came to the phone and told me much as his subordinate had. I pointed out that this was the second time in succession that British Gas had failed to meet a commitment that it had made to me to attend my premises within a time period of their choosing to service my boiler and this was unacceptable. He said that an engineer would be with me by 6pm. I then questioned the value of British Gas's promise to attend within a 2 hour time slot, as I was being asked to wait a further 4 hours on top of the promised 2... I pointed out that while I appreciated his apology, his employers were patently failing, again, to deliver the service for which we were paying. Eventually, he offered to make an ex gratia payment of £30 to the credit of our account.. While this does not compensate for their failure to deliver, it is at least a financial recognition of that failure and if every unhappy customer was paid such compensation, British Gas might have a further incentive to improve their service - perhaps by employing more engineers to meet the demand for their service.

5,"            I was very impressed with the whole process. The engineer who did the boiler installation was thorough and took time to explain what he was doing. He was also very patient in demonstrating Hive and setting it up for us. The additional pipe and drain-away which required the lifting-up of some patio slabs was also done very carefully and is practically impossible to detect now. The removal of the old controller, replacing it with the Hive unit and adding a supplementary thermostat was also done very well. All in all a very professional job.

I phoned the number to let them know about my move and that I wanted to switch the supply. They advised me the team to do that wasn’t available and it would take 2-4 weeks to set up my account. This could mean I am charged significantly for moving into a new home. The person who handled my call was very quick to try and end the call with me as soon as they realised they couldn’t assist me with the account setup. They didn’t ask if I needed help with anything else and didn’t explain the rates that I am currently on. There was no warm welcome or attempt to make me feel like I should have any reason to stay with British Gas, I think I’ve made the right decision to switch supply.

The underlying issue being my boiler running on calor gas, but I went to the trouble of reminding British Gas of this on several occasions. And the delays between available booking slots were unacceptable. Makes the National adverts about engineers phoning ahead both laughable and very irritating! Customer services were helpful enough but the management of my booking very poor - not even telling me they were unable to send an engineer hence wasting my time.

1,"            I've wasted so much time on British Gas over the past couple of months, that I'm going to keep this brief and sum up my abysmal experience, as going into too much detail will just agitate me.I have been trying to switch my pay as you go metre to a smart metre for around 2 months now.Appointment 1: I took the day off from work and the engineer never showed up. I called twice to check on the engineers status and both times I was told that I was in the diary and the engineer would be with me shortly. As mentioned, he never showed up. I waited 2 weeks for that appointment.I spent a long time on the phone with various customer service reps and eventually got another appointment for 4 weeks later. The earliest appointment they could give - you can imagine my frustration.Appointment 2: Four weeks later, the engineer came to install my smart metre, noticed an anomaly and said he couldn't carry out the job. He called  another department to check up on the anomaly and said they would be in touch with me to fix an appointment.Four days later, still no call so I called and and eventually made another appointment for 2 weeks later. Again, the earliest they had.Appointment 3: The engineer saw no problem and said the initial engineer should have installed my smart metre. Again, you can imagine my frustration.Spoke to British Gas complaints department following this appointment and was told the earliest appointment they can make is in another 4 weeks. I called back to speak to a customer service rep about whether there was anything they could do to bring forward the appointment, given how long I've waited, and the man I was speaking with was SO unhelpful that I asked to speak with someone else, and the man hung up on me. He actually hung up on me. So basically it's going to take around 12 weeks - that's 3 months, people! - to simply install a smart metre.It's a joke! I'm currently researching other energy providers.

3,"            Bit of a saga, booked engineers to replace 5 rads. Only 4 rads delivered the day before fitting and unfortunately the engineer failed to turn up due to scheduling issue. Engineer did come and see me and apologised and realised that one of the rads delivered was wrong and asked for the missing rad plus exchange for the other. These were to be delivered the following week prior to 2nd attempt to fit. Only the missing rad arrived, still no replacement for wrong one sent.Then the exchange rad turns up on day of fitting and guess what, it was wrong rad:-)Fitting went well but an engineer had to drive to Salford to pick up exchange Rad which wasted my time and theres.The engineers were good but the service received from there RAD supplier was shocking to put it mildly.

1,"            When things go well with British Gas everything ticks along quite nicely. However if you are unfortunate enough to actually need their support to fix an issue I can only hope you don’t have the same experience as me. To summarise, approx 11 visits were required over a 3/4 month period for the same problem. It appeared the final and most expensive item to replace in the boiler (c. £300) was the one required. Unfortunately I had to take a serious amount of time off and while the engineers all did whatever they could it took sheer desperation and at times begging to try to get British Gas to acknowledge the problem required more than a quick boiler check over. An incredibly frustrating experience,   cancelled visits, I lost a lot of my annual leave to British Gas & time. I submitted a complaint approx 3 months ago, I’ve heard nothing from them since a letter acknowledging my complaint and a follow up letting me know they were still investigating 2 months after, although I since found out that after 8 weeks no one had even been allocated or looked at the complaint. I have tried to get answers via every channel available, while the staff have been as helpful as they can be, there are clearly some issues at British Gas which prevent them from providing better customer support and service. It appears British Gas don’t give a fig, if you do decide to go with their home care service all I can do is wish you the very best of luck, and recommend you save a couple of weeks of annual leave to accommodate all of the engineer visits.

When they fitted the boiler they found I had a small gas leak at the meter (nothing to do with their work must have had it for some time). The engineer contacted the right people who were able to locate the gas pipe in the road, cut off the gas, fit a new meter and connect the gas supply again at no extra cost to me. It was during the cold spell and I was offered heaters to keep me warm until everything was working again. Brilliant

1,"            British Gas Homecare. We have been with them for over 30 years so you would think they would give us some sort of vague respect? No chance. Booked an annual service in November 2017 which was arranged for 31 Jan 2018. The engineer didn't turn up and BG said they cancelled it due to too many emergency calls - but they did not tell us!! Got £30 compensation and rearranged for 28 Mar 2018. Engineer didn't arrive again despite the online service telling me they were on their way. BG said they rang to cancel but they didn't - no missed calls and no messages. Raised a formal complaint hoping something would change,  more in hope than expectation. They still had my previous address on file despite me telling them numerous times we moved 4 years ago, so a letter acknowledging the complaint was sent there and not to our current address. They offerred £50 compensation, even though our boiler had not been serviced since 2016.Engineer turned up today (when they arrive they are good to be fair) and he had our name wrong - the previous occupant no less, despite me telling BG he moved out 4 years ago. Their systems are cr@p and are not integrated. You might as well not bother updating anything because nothing will change.We are cancelling our cover after over 30 years as customers because we feel they will not get better, only worse. We will go with a local service.Pity. We ain't going back.

1,"            Re: Kitchen Appliance Cover Policy No 911001176866At about midday Friday 6th April, my wife contacted you to report a serious issue with our washing machine – it had caused a complete power outage, and only with the help of the electricity supplier, was it identified as being the washing machine.Unlike our previous supplier, Domestic and General, we were not offered next day service, but Monday 9th 12 – 6pm. Late afternoon we were told that due to unexpected heating call outs, the electrician would come next day. ? Why would unexpected heating call outs affect a washing machine?Tuesday 10th 1:30pm Contacted you to ask when are you coming? Advisor says ‘You’re booked in for 12 – 6pm.Tuesday 10th 6pm No contact by British Gas. I contact you. Advisor apologises, but as it’s not an emergency, she can only offer next day. [Should I send a photo of the washing piling up from having 4 grandchildren and their parents staying over Easter? Any one with that amount of washing sees that as emergency, as my ears can testify.] She did apologise for that and offered £30 in lieu of a complaint, which I refused. Appointment arranged at my insistence between 8-10am Wednesday.Wednesday 11th Electrician turns up at 9:15, replaces the broken heating element within 30 mins.Thursday 12th I receive a call to complete an automated survey. In response to the question on a scale of  0 to 10 ‘Would I recommend BGas’ I pressed 1, was asked to confirm that, and then to give my reasons. I gave a short polite summary of the above. At the end, I waited, and then a female voice said ‘there has been a serious failure’ – I though this referred to my complaint, but no, a male US-accented voice said ‘This programme is closing down’ and then the female voice said ‘you have been unable to complete your call’. Coincidence? Is this another way of avoiding negative feedback?I then try to submit this online form and get the pop-up message 'Oops, something went wrong please try later'. Another coincidence?In summary:Service failure Monday – but prior notice given2nd service failure – but no notice given£30 compensation offered to avoid a formal complaint.My viewA service failure deserves recompense.A second service failure justifies a complaint. I understand the difference between (1) a service failure, and then (2) a failure to remedy that failure that then leads to a complaint. What I don’t understand is why I am not entitled to the £30 service failure compensation, if I want to take it further and make a formal complaint. I lose my right to the £30, and then rely on BG’s complaint resolution process.  In retrospect, I switched to BG because I am a long-time BG customer for central heating, and your kitchen appliance cover was considerably cheaper than D&G, who had provided excellent service for the last ten years. Your advertising literature didn’t make it clear that cheaper prices might mean a lower quality of service.

1,"            Absolute charlatans in my opinion. Bought our first property which they were the supplier for (but we didn't know). Two days after moving in I switched to another supplier. I didn't realise this would take so long but in the end it ended up taking four weeks.British Gas sent us a bill for £106 for the gas alone. I called up to complain that this should be nearer to £35 but because I (naively) hadn't taken a reading they were not budging and suggested I called up the previous owner to argue the toss. I have now received another bill for £76 for the electricity... so for four weeks gas and electricity they want to charge £182. I totally accept that there were things I should have done that I had not that (taking readings), but when you move into a house, you are very busy trying to live out of boxes and getting everything sorted.There are two of us living in this house and we are both out of the house for 12 hours a day (7am to 7pm) and don't use a lot of power.Our current provider is somewhere nearer £50 a month for both so their charge is approximately three and half times the cost.I will never ever use them.There phone team are expertly trained not to care and to take you for all your money.Horrible company. Should be ashamed of themselves and the British name.Go to any comparison website and never use this company would be my advice

2,"            We reported electrical circuit breakdown throughout May Day holidays 28-29-30. No assistance was available to us from BG. We therefore were forced to our own resources  and to maintain Central Heating/Boiler  and all Cooking facilities . All Food Refrigeration systems . All Domestic and Home Telephone and Computing systems . We were blessed to have extremely capable and generous neighbours who helped determine the cause of the the continuous tripping of the main fuse box ( water leaking from boiler to point serving the washing machine ). The boiler is only 3 years old and was serviced 22nd Feb 2018.We were then advised to contact BG to reassess the boiler to ensure that we were secured against any further water ingress from boiler into electrical systems.The BG engineer came on Tuesday 8th May. He found traces of water in the boiler but could not determine to source of the  ingress which had contributed to the original tripping of the main house electric board.The engineer changed the new 13 amp fuse in the electric wall  fitting connecting the washing machine and which had been fitted during the repairs effected over the long May holiday weekend. This 13 amp fuse had been working perfectly well before . 2 hours after he left us my wife then started up the washing machine and within a short while the 3 amp fuse failed and the w/machine cycle was severely interrupted. We have ( our neighbours ) since replaced the 3amp fuse for a 13 amp fuse which is most suitable and restored the washing machine and electric  circuit once more. We understand that the smaller fuse is unsuitable for the work load requirements for our w/machine.I won’t tell you further  about my telephone conversations with a BG service operative on the evening of 8fh May. No doubt you will have a telephone transcript for trading purposes.Hopefully I will hear from BG following my experience .These reports tend to disappear into the ether .I am sorry that my report has benn necessary.Sincerely Brian Thompson

1,"            I feel very let down by British Gas. I have a service contract with them that includes an annual service to my boiler - but annual it is not! My boiler is supposed to be serviced every February, but when I phoned British Gas just after Christmas to arrange a date for this, the earliest appointment they could offer me was at the end of March. I accepted this, but a few days before they were supposed to come they rang to cancel blaming the high volume of call outs they had due to the bad weather. I was not happy, particularly when they told me that the earliest appointment they could now offer me for my annual service was June! However, this week they phoned again to cancel and rearrange for July! What sort of service is this? So this annual service due last February should now happen in July - unless British Gas decide to cancel for a third time. This is a dreadful service and, in my opinion, not worth it.

Only after 48 hours did you publish any ideas for self help. We had to get a commercial company to rescue us from a very bad situation. To be without hot water and no central heating for 3 days was bad enough but to be totally unable to reach British Gas by any method during that time be it phone e-mail etc was unforgivable. Since that time the response to letters has been very slow and inadequate and we still do not have ant explanation. We can see why they are losing so many customers daily. We have very little trust in the management of this company and once we do get a reply to our letter we will decide what action we will do. There is also the question of additional costs which amount to over £200 so far, who will compensate us for this complete breakdown in promised services.

2,"            Terrible customer service, after being a customer for 8 years and taking them to our new house they firstly got my meter readings wrong and hung up the phone on me when I got frustrated with the woman to change them around.Then after a year we discovered they were sending post with OUR account details on to our old house. The best bit about this was that thw occupiers of our old house could squiggle on the bottom, post back and claim a £50 shopping voucher! Meanwhile, we are then signed up to some sort of home start scheme and billed whatever the cost was a month!!When I called to tell them they shouldn't be passing our information  to our old address the answer we got was that it is illegal for someone to open post not addressed to them....my point was I don't wish to take the chance. Its illegal for people to do many things.....doesn't stop them lol. They wouldn't seem to understand that someone could cost us money by signing us up to something, they don't have my signature on anything so they couldn't compare it.Needless to say, they hung up.We changed to OVO.  So far so good.

1,"            British gas received a request from a different supplier to switch my gas and electric across to them under the name of somebody not associated with my property at all.  Whilst I've been through the whole process with both suppliers of how this works etc, the following customer service and response times of when somebody will reply to me has been appalling. Passed from pillar to post, promised calls and not had them, fobbed off with excuses and not even a response when promised to a complaint email sent which was copied to the energy ombudsmen.  This doesn't even touch the tip of the iceberg of all the hassle and inconvenience this has caused which is why I would never be coming back to British Gas at all and would advise others to stay away as they're also very expensive.  Still waiting on a response to solve my current issue and have thankfully got a different supplier.

He said we need a flue in one piece, which I understood and asked for a quote.  I was given a quote of £260 a couple of weeks later which I accepted. When my partner and I tried to make an appointment they said it was not urgent...  We said it was as the engineer said the boiler was not safe to use...  It was intimated that this was a precaution... Our position was that then they needed to advise the boiler was safe to use to deem it non urgent..BG cannot say a boiler with a unsafe inspection report is not an urgent repair..!!!!!  Most unprofessional.   We await BG to reinstate the Gas safe cover on my boiler and response to a complaint

If he had carried out the cursory minimum that I was expecting then I was prepared to cancel my contract when he left. Fortunately the young man that did turn up did a far better job than I expected and went above and beyond, finding faults that had previously been ignored and correcting them to the point that he left my system in better shape than it had been for the last 4 years.

2,"            A difficult relationship with British Gas. On two occasions, engineers have failed to attend despite appointments being made and confirmed well in advance. Reasons for them not attending are always 'systems down' or 'other emergency calls'. These aren't problems in themselves necessarily but there is zero communication until you call British Gas after your appointment time and they reel off the excuses. It's totally unacceptable for one of 'the best' home service providers.Their complaint resolution also leaves a lot to be desired - they offer £30 for a missed appointment. This is pittance for someone who then has to take another day off work. On both occasions I have rejected this initial offer and received more than double on both occasions in compensation when British Gas admit they were in the wrong. It is also very telling when a company like this takes 12 weeks to address complaints because of a backlog - how many complaints can there be?I cannot fault the engineers when they do eventually arrive, outstanding service everytime. But the way this company treats customers and has no regard for the fact we pay good money for them to provide a decent service is unacceptable. I will not be renewing and will never return and in all honesty, I cannot recommend them.Oh, and the app is terrible. To British Gas engineers - you're being let down by your company, you do a great job and deserve better - get out and move on.

Heard nothing for weeks so I telephoned them. The person I spoke to initially couldnt get through to the dept. that dealt with the appointments and was promised a call back.. No call. I rang again after 10 days and was told the engineers were dealing with emergencies ie people with no heating or hot water so were basically run off their feet and were not free to do my work. This I accepted as it was in March. By this time I had been waiting two months for some idea when the work could be done. This brings me to 28th April when I received a call from British Gas asking me what was the best suitable days etc that the Flush could be done, I told the young lady all the specific days, dates etc and again she tried to get through to the relevant dept to book and confirm a date, she wasnt able to reach the  dept that deals with the appointment to do this job.  We will ring you back. Again no call. Fast forward to 3rd May, I rang British Gas and in short I was TOLD THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO HAD RANG ME ON THE 28TH APRIL, and that there was no way the job could be done in the forseeable future as they still were only dealing with people with no heating, hot water etc BECAUSE THEY HAVENT THE ENGINEERS  TO DO THE WORK AS ITS AN ALL DAY JOB TO DO. They said they will ring me in 4weeks {JUNE} to see whether there will be any dates available in the forseeable future. I have Home Plan and agreed to pay the £600+ to get the job done, so if there are no engineers free to do this work WHY are they stipulating and avertising this proceedure as being available if they cant live up to their own blog. I am utterly disgusted with British Gas I never expected to receive this awful cutomer service from them. It will be interesting in June to see what their excuse will be then as to why they cant or wont do the job.

Three months later, the day before the service I received a phonecall saying 'due to high demand and staff sickness they needed to cancel and the next available appointment would be in three months'. The day before the second appointment, (yes, six months after making the original booking) I received the same phone call, 'sorry, due to high demand and staff sickness we need to cancel and rearrange'. Which led to an arguement and friction during the call why I was not happy to cancel and British Gas saying they had no choice. After asking to speak to their supervision, explaining my 'customer journey experience' and telling them I believed they were in breach of contract (one annual service every 12mths) as the service had been due three months earlier. Surprisingly enough BG kept their appointment. I believe British Gas has more customers than they can actually manage with the resources they have. That's how I was made to feel anyway.Will I renew in October, it's not likely!

They failed to check the gas connection was correct coming in from the road so when the boiler was fitted couldn't work till we had all the drive dug up (twice) to sort out the pipe work, then the meter had to be moved. A complete nightmare. When we had the quote at the beginning, we were sold a hive system, were told it would work if wi fi went down, it doesn't. We don't do technology, don't have smart phones etc, and told salesman so, yet were still sold the system as being ""best for us"". The thermostat has been fitted on the same wall as the oven so when the oven is on the heating goes off. The Manager was extremely rude when we complained. Eventually contacted the CEO.

1,"            I have had British Gas Landlord products since 1998. They used to be the Flagship of the industry. They are shoddy & unprofessional at best now. They are slow to respond to complaints. I nearly always have a problem with them on every encounter. They use lots of subbies that I just refuse completely now. If you do not tell them not to send them, that will often be who is sent. They scaremonger my tenants. I have just solved one issue with 1 of my properties where British Gas attended & turned off the supply because, as the engineer wrote possible risk of CO poisoning, due to an obsolete part. This part was not perished & did not need to be replaced at present. I called out a second medium sized company, who were happy to turn it back on, but got a second opinion & then had it turned back on. I would not risk my tenants. These companies stake their name & career on turning this back on. That is how confident they are, & how incompetent British Gas can be. I can't say if the incompetence lay mainly with the fact that the engineer was too lazy to do his job, & this was easier for him, or just that British Gas push their engineers to push for replacement boilers because they charge a fortune for doing so, plus their maintenance expectations go down. They charge you the same, with potentially a much lower cost to themselves. Also the engineers are incentivised to generate more chargeable work - & even quotes! I At Christmas I had one property where British Gas attended 7 times. The first time was just a service, & it worked when they turned up, & they cocked it up. It took them almost 2 months to correct it, & on most of the visits their engineers sat in the van for more time afterwards on the phone to their pals, than the time spent in the property. The subbies leave, call through & shoot off. It is no wonder you have to wait up to a week & suffer cancelled visits when they are incompetent, or don't move straight on to the next job. I am looking for a good & reliable company to take over all of my contracts. I try to be a good landlord & give my tenants piece of mind. I can only be as good as the people I employ, & British Gas are a massive disappointment at the moment, & have been gradually reaching this point for the last few years. All of this which doesn't include the fact that you can ring as often as you like, generally have to wait ages (in excess of 20 minutes) & half the time their 'system' is down, & they can't do anything, or agree that you haven't been dealt with fairly or properly prior, & please call back because they can't do anything either!!!!!

Waited until 5:30pm and we called them again (waited for the mandatory 20+ minutes or so), only to be told that the engineer had been too busy and wouldn't be able to attend. I waited in an empty house for 6 hours. I would at the very least have expected a phone call. The person I initially spoke to on the phone really didn't seem surprised and in fact said that the engineer may have been called out to a life threatening emergency (which seemed a bit of an exaggeration). He told that he was the most senior person to talk to, which was odd as he passed me to his manager after a while. This whole experience has put me off using British Gas for anything ever again, I will hopefully get my rescheduled service done on time and will then cancel the contract. My suggestion to British Gas would be to spend less money on advertising and promising a great service and spend more money fixing issues a delivering a basic service correctly.

It would appear that BG has a standard policy of cancelling appointments at the last minute, having a three month waiting list for another appointment, and having a completely useless customer services department. After more than a year of dreadfully bad service, I received a renewal for my Home Care with an increase of 16% based on inaccurate figures. Needless to say, I told them I would not be renewing (but in more colourful language) and the follow up from customer services was just laughable. A lady from BG contacted me, and gave me a number to ring back. That number actually did not get through to her, but to a chap in a different office! So I left a message asking for a call back on my mobile. No longer at all surprised by the total inability of BG to get even the simplest things right, she rang me on my land line, vaguely muttering about the wrong figures quoted to me, but offering me little else. I cancelled the renewal and felt  a sense of relief that I would have nothing to do with BG ever again.

I have provided them with the following:-a)	A copy of 2 installation records on British Gas headed paper issued by their 2 engineers (who are both identified by their numbered ID.b)	A copy of the approval and agreement sent by British Gasc)	A copy of the invoice British Gas for £2333I spoke to several people on each occasion and eventually spoke to Linda Rotondo and Duane Cotterell who both promised to get back to me, which they failed to do.  I finally spoke to Nadia Nur who finally raised the issue with the right people.  I then spoke to George Moore who looked into the matter and finally told me that they did not issue the certificate at the time (which they should have done) and that British Gas no longer issue these certificates themselves.   This whole process has taken 6 weeks and I am no further in getting the certificate my aunt needs.  She will now have to pay someone else to do this.  British Gas have a) failed in their duty of care to do their job b) failed to provide the necessary paper work and are now unable to remedy the situation c) have possibly failed to meet their contract with her.This is not good custumer care!

The person on the other end of the phone assured me the Engineers would be there.At 10.40am on the 16th while waiting at home, I rang and asked if the engineers were still coming. Yes I was told.At 12.50 , BG rang and said the Engineers were held up on a gas leak ?? They promised me £ 30 compensation.The engineers arrived at 2.30pm and left at 3.20pm. I asked the Engineers if they had been busy and they said no???On the 26th April I rang BG and asked if my payment had been processed ??? The lady obviously had a problem and re-requested my payment. Today ( 1st May ) I rang again and the lady on the other end could not tell me where that payment only that it was requested and on file   but would get her Manager to ring me. I am really looking forward to the next set of excuses.Fortunately I have left BG and gone to Npower . Much easier to deal with .I owe BG approx £22 - I wonder if I should pay ?????

2,"            Have a Homecare policy with BG. Their appointment setting and failure of engineers to turn up, call centre performance dire, wait times horrendous, lead me to invoke help of one of their senior managers who worked for me in an earlier life. Profuse apologies and compensation rather than good service  resolved my ire. This year same again, couldn’t get an annual service appointment. In between times boiler broke down and I had to pay a £60 excess which I wouldn’t have had to do if they had serviced the thing on time. Can only give you an apptmt two days hence. We have an 8 year old who needs heating and water. Sorry no can do. Used their website to get a day earlier apptmt but on the day only the already booked one was showing. Back to the call centre. Sorry can’t see any apptmt for today so you will need to wait until tomorrow. My phone goes Hi it is the BG engineer I will be with you in 15 mins. So the apptmt I had booked online was in fact valid. I had booked it for the afternoon but somehow the engineer had it booked in for the morning. Anyway BG are really lucky to have engineers like Malcolm in Chelmsford. He was amazingly understanding and helpful as well as very good indeed at his job. Why can’t the rest of BG be like him. I will be cancelling the policy and also the one on our other house as BG are useless. They just waste so much of your time and cause unnecessary stress levels.

Once we agreed on the bill, I paid it straight away. Few days later, I found out that y credit score was affected by this. I emailed the British Gas and they kept ignoring my emails for 4 weeks. I wanted to know why my credit score was affected as I paid it immediately once the bill was correct. I had to complain to sort this out. They couldn’t explain to me why the credit score was affected. Useless. The customer service is beyond poor. They offered £20 as a compensation. I had to laugh as this would not cover all my stress and rejected mortgage application because of that.

But they lower it to much so I end up owing them and they can just do as they please and take whatever they want out of my account what about people who budget to what they need for other bills they really don't care absolutely disgusted I've been a dual fuel customer for years and this is how I get treated.

I had a problem with their HOMECARE service and it took nearly six months to get a response.My elderly parents are receiving distressing and threatening letters demanding money that isn't owed and warnings that a debt collection agency will be employed, after signing up to a HOMECARE agreement.Despite letters, e-mails and calls to British Gas they will not respond to say whether this is an error or fraud. So I have no choice other than to waste overstretched POLICE resources and report as fraud.In 2017 British Gas lost around 823,000 customer in four months and if their customer service is anything to go by, I can see why. They can now likely add two more households to their running total.Maybe the appalling service is due to cutbacks, along with constant fuel increases in order to support the CEO's very substantial pay.

1,"            I decided to take British Gas landlord cover to take the stress out of needing to find a gas servicer who could keep my boiler safe for my tenants and to ensure I have the adequate  legal checks in place.   The first service and certification was a nightmare the second was even worse.   One of the attractions of the policy was the promise of a reminder that the certification was due.   I roughly know when my certificate was due but after not receiving a reminder I decided to online service my account and check my certificate.   The certificate was not available for me to view although British Gas promise your documents will be online for you to view.   As I thought my certificate must be due I decided to book an online engineer appointment and whilst completing the online process a pop appeared telling me my certificate had expired three months before.   Is there any point paying close to £200 per year to not be able to view your certificate and to not get a reminder.   I promptly booked an engineer visit and the engineer called as promised to let me know they’re on their way, what actually happened is the engineer screamed 10 minutes down the phone and put the phone down.   Now in reality most landlords don’t live right next to their properties I myself live 10 miles away and work 20 miles away.   At either location I was never going to make the appointment in 10 minutes  but I did my best.   Most working people cannot  sit outside tenants house  five hours waiting for an  engineer.  I did make it being one minute late due to the road being closed but the engineer refused to wait as she was already in her vehicle, she shook her head and drove off.   So if you have one property or 10 properties and you don’t live next door to them this cover  isn’t really for you.   I will be  cancelling my cover as soon as the renewal date comes up and will be giving the work to a local company who care for their customers and not a company who makes millions of pounds a year and think it’s okay to treat customers in such an appalling way.  This is a frustration after a number of occasions where British Gas have failed, the last two occasions I have needed to use the cover the phone lines have been switched off due to British Gas not been out to cope with call volumes.

I tried calling (on hold for 14 minutes before giving up) and e-mailing (had responses but neither were able to answer my query) and in the end I managed to speak to someone via their online chat feature. The lady I spoke with (Kathryn) was lovely and very polite and understanding of my confusion and explained the bill is a result of a debit on my account and an estimated usage based on previous months. So I asked what the cost to me would be if i decided to leave British Gas - the debit that's built up is £226! Which, split over the next 6 months would be £37 a month. On top of my standard £31 bill = £68 a month. WHERE has £96 come from?? And how do British Gas allow customers to build up such high debts?? Baffled. So I'm switching suppliers to a much smaller company called Bulb which comes highly recommended! NOT looking forward to my final bill from BG :( Would not switch to British Gas again but it gets 2 stars purely for the lovely lady who helped me via the online chat.

I noticed what I believed were minor leaks beneath the boiler and new radiator valves and was assured by British Gas that copper pipes sweat with condensation. Water pressure in the system would reduce but BG claimed this was normal on Vaillant boilers. This is not the case. The wall has blown out with water damage taking my bathroom with it, this damage is not covered by insurance or warranty. The boiler has been identified as the cause with what has been described as a major water leak due to a poor installation.

1,"            Firstly, after almost a year since we left British Gas we have received another ‘Final bill’ (having had a final bill when we left ), so not sure how many final bills someone could get. This last final bill dated on 10.04.2018, having a really unclear calculation, due to be paid on 20.04.2018 was received by post as an already opened letter on the date of the 18th of April 2018, therefore giving us about 6 days ( only 4 working days) to find £ 264.27 to pay this bill. I was also sent a text and an email saying that if this bill is not paid in time is going to affect my credit score. I no longer have access to my account to check if this bill is accurate. B Gas customer service has agreed to sent me an email with the meter opening, but never got one. I’m really unhappy of the whole situation. Its B Gas fault that you couldn’t get all these sorted out when we left, and now claiming to have the payment done in time, which I’m not sure if its right or not. And thanks to B Gas smart meter readings we had wrong readings when we have opened a new meter reading whit the new supplier. B Gas  has caused a lot of issues. It is very unprofessional the way they work and I would recommend to anyone to look elsewhere if they want a better treatment.

1,"            Thanks British Gas for your insult of a cheque for £30.00,  as a gesture of good will for your shoddy service. 3 days of broken appointments before an engineer finally attended and diagnosed the fault with the boiler. Another three days and more broken appointments before part finally fitted.So a young family of four without running hot water and central heating for nearly a week.Make the cheque out for £300 please. Truly abysmal performance and a lot of stress, misery and discomfort to my tenants and a lot of stress and frustration for me. Absolutely disgusted and infuriated.

1,"            Shocking service. Rang last Thursday with no heating and hot water. Adviced the soonest they could get someone out was Monday,  Monday afternoon had a call from British has saying sorry no one can get there today so booked for Tuesday.  Again same scenario no one turned up on Tuesday as too many emergency’s😡.  Appointment booked for Wednesday and an engineer turns up in a white van and after damaging my boiler front adviced he needed parts and will be back the next day.  After 2 days off work in annoyed that they can provide this poor service. The other thing that angered me is I pay for British Gas engineers and the guy who turned up in my experience was not very thorough and didn’t seem to know what was wrong. Hopefully when he returns it will be sorted.

I did this about 2 months ago, received confirmation email, service due today, nobody turns up. Log on to my account and no record of it! Had to rebook it and wait for best part of 2 months!It is a corporate wide scam, cancelling cover today.

1,"            Ww purchased an expensive Boiler System with the Hive facility from British Gas four  years ago and we are still paying for it.  The hub stopped working today, I contacted Hive (apparently they are a separate company from British Gas or so they said) and after 2 phone calls the last one lasting for 1 hour 45 minutes I was eventually told that the hub I have is no longer supported by Hive.  Why it took her this long to fathom this out I don't know.  So an expensive system I purchased is now useless to me as I cant use it via my mobile.  I was told my heating system was an old type!!!!!!!!! and it isn't supported anymore.  The only option was to upgrade at a cost of £19.99 per month or one off payment of £99.00????????  After much deliberation (lol) I went for the one off payment.  Asked for a receipt but apparently there system is not geared up to give receipts, what a load of rubbish.  I wonder how long this latest hub will last before I have to upgrade again?  Furthermore because I was on the phone for longer than an hour I will be penalised financially by my phone company.  I think I was mis sold by British Gas, I was never told that the Hive system would be of no use if the hub ever went wrong.   BEWARE OF ANY DEALINGS WITH   HIVE  !!!!  or British Gas!!

1,"            Long story short.  I lived in a rented house and as the landlord lived abroad BG had my contact details for Homeserve.  Having left the property I received email/text to say they were doing a service, I explained I'd left the property (this is about 7 years ago) and heard nothing more until 3 years ago.  Again emails etc saying wanted to do service.  The hassle in trying to get them to remove my details from their system was unbievable so I said I would charge them £50 for each unsolicited contact and actually got £100 out of them. But they assured me they had removed details.  Then again last year same happened.  They were unbelievably rude when I tried to sort it, they even asked me to confirm my account details when they rang me - the whole point is I don't have an account.  Got so fed up didn't even bother to accept the £60 they offered.  But guess what it's all started again.  Have sent several emails but nothing in return, totally ignoring me.  They clearly have my personal details including email and phone number on their system which is illegal as I am not - and never will be - a BG customer.

On 4th April they rang to cancel stating an unprecedented number of emergency call outs and then gave me the next available date of 18th May.The boiler actually broke down on 10th April so no hot water or heating.I asked for emergency call out and was told I could have an engineer on 24th April but if I got somebody else to fix it they would refund me up to £199.So, what am I getting for my £230 per year?. An annual service that isn't annual ( still waiting for it) Emergency call out when I need it isn't available for two weeks. You only have to read similar reviews outlining the same problems to realise that taking out their homecare plan is a complete waste of money and my advice is, DON'T DO IT!

1,"            I have been very disappointed with British Gas Homecare. About 4 months ago I arranged for the annual service, but received a letter 2 days before it was due to say it was cancelled due to high demand on the engineers and they would be in touch to rearrange the appointment. They never got in touch so I went on line and made another appointment and the soonest I could get was for about 6 weeks time, so I booked it. The day before my next appointment was due I got a phone call to tell me it was cancelled again for the same reason! I did object this time as I had made arrangements to be off work and really wanted to keep this appointment. This however was not an option but they compensated me after I objected £30, I would have preferred to keep my appointment. They offered me the following Monday, but couldn't give me a time between 8 and 10am so I could fit it in before work. So I left it that I would book online once I knew when I could be home. I later that day went online to rebook my appointment and there was an appointment available for the next day!!! The day they told me I had to cancel!! Something is wrong with their system. I did phone up complaints to let them know and they did compensate me a further £30 as they had cancelled my appointment twice. On this occasion the lady was very nice and apologetic. The engineer did arrive the next day, although didn't manage to arrive in the allotted time. He asked me was I having any problems which I explained about the pump continuing to run sometimes after the heating has gone off. He tested some valves but they were all ok. I just assumed this was all part of the service. He certainly never quoted for doing this and explained there would be a charge if he checked them. A couple of days later I got an invoice for £60 form British Gas. When I called to find out why, I was told  it was for checking the zone valves. I explained that the engineer never quoted for the work or explained there would be a charge and that he had asked me if we were having any problems. The lady did drop the charge, however, according to her it was me at fault as the engineer doesn't know what contract I have and what I am covered for. Apparently I should have known testing the zone valves isn't part of the service. I feel the engineers should be aware of what cover each customer has and if any work needs to be carried out which they are not covered for, they should make them aware of any extra costs. In fact there is a box at the end of the customer check list which i have since seen which should be ticked if chargeable work has been quoted for/completed on the visit. This wasn't ticked. May be he should have checked with me which was why the lady dropped the charge, although if that was the case, why didn't she apologise and say that? Overall I have been very unhappy with British Gas. They have compensated me and dropped the £60 charge, but there certainly are a few issues which need addressing by British Gas to avoid these problems happening. I appreciate British Gas has busy periods in Winter, but not in April. Customers should be given the option to cancel or not, and then if they agree to cancel offer the compensation as a gesture of goodwill.

1,"            Where do I start!!!I’ve had BG Homecare cover for over 20 years and for the first probably 15 of those years I thought they were very good, I could call with a problem and often they would be there within 24 hours, but over more recent years the service has been shocking every time ! When I’ve had an appliance breakdown or problem with my boiler the best they can offer an engineer is 7-10 days just to look at the issue then if it needs a part it can be days or a wk again to repair, rubbish rubbish service. Even the engineers recognise the poor service and that it’s not what it used to be!My latest issue is that having paid for over 20 years for electrical cover I called yesterday as all my sockets in the kitchen had tripped so my fridge and freezer etc weren’t working and having just had all my food arrive earlier in the day they were full. I tried to flick the trip switch, unplugged everything, pulled everything out but still couldn’t see what the problem was. So I called British Gas, explained and the best they could offer me was an appointment in 6 days time. I was fuming knowing all my food would be off by then and I would not be able to cook etc! I have ended up calling our own electrician to sort the problem. Why have I bothered to continue to pay them for so long. I would advise anybody to take out homecare cover with them and I need to look elsewhere it’s got beyond a joke now! I’ve got everything with them at the moment, even my utilities but not for much longer. As soon as my contract is up next month I’m switching.

For years we had a service in March, but thanks to British Gas , who always delay sevices, we have been given a date in June! When  asked to speak to a manager I was told “they can’t do anything.”So, basically, do not take out Homecare, you will not get an annual service, you will pay for an annual service but will actually wait 14/15 months between services.The contract was taken out to have an annual service and that is what we expect to get.

They would come, tinker with it, get me to spend loads of money fitting stuff that didn't actually fix the problems.  The engineer would leave and thirty minutes later the problems would come back.  They've wasted my time, energy and money.  Finally, the last engineer who came round and seemed like a decentish kind of bloke had the decency to tell me that I needed a new boiler. I finally was left with no hot water or heating for the umpteenth time.  I was fed up.  Called Boxt, had a new boiler fitted within two days and finally can have a bath and wash my hair.

Having no heating or hot water, British gas said due to them being very busy, they couldn’t get out to me until the following Wednesday afternoon. Reorganising my day, I waited for them but received a call instead telling me they were still too busy and had to rearrange for the Friday afternoon. I have waited in again and no one turned up. I called them (waiting 28 minutes initially for someone to answer plus 25 more exclaining the problem and further waits to speak to a manager). They tried to find out why no one had called or turned up for the appointment but they couldn’t get to speak to anyone. They now say the only thing they can do is offer another appointment next Tuesday (9 days after the fault was reported) and offered a small cash sum which I am not interested in. I just want my boiler fixed. I live out of town and it’s a 5 mile round trip to go to the local gym for a shower. I have two children 11 and 13 who are constantly cold. I am not impressed with bristish gas. I do not delay paying our monthly fees to them but they seem to think it is acceptable to keep us waiting for over a week.  I will think twice about renewing any future contract with them and would recommend others to look elsewhere.  I bet if I called british gas to give me a quote for a new boiler, they would be out in 48 hrs!

1,"            Boiler breakdown. My husband is a vulnerable adult and we have homecare so an engineer was with us in 30 minutes. Superb. Boiler not repairable so was advised that we would get £700 discount on new boiler. We couldn't get a quote unless we had a visit from an assessor. He came in an hour. Again superb. Quote was £1k more (£300 after the supposed 'discount') than a like for like from BOXT and based on a cheaper boiler!  In waiting we had lost the next day installation slot on offer from BOXT. Despite our willingness to pay the £300 could only offer a 3 day installation date for a vulnerable adult. We had no heating and no hot water. Called BOXT and threw ourselves on their mercy,  they did it cheaper and the next day. Good staff at BG but shame on the company for misleading discounts. Feel very disappointed indeed.

1,"            I switched to Avroenergy last year in December via Flipper. They were instructed to take over both electric and gas to get us of the overpriced British Gas standard tariff. Instead they rejected Averoenergy's request to take over the gas as instructed by us the customer and they refused to give Averoenergy a reason. They then took £236 out of our account this April as a final bill while Avero charged us £91.00 So as far as I am concerned British Gas are non-compliant with the regulators and have acted in greed to rob us of money we had a right to save. I will NEVER use their ""service"" again and I have made sure all my accounts have blocked any future payment to them.

Engineers appear to be incentivised to get in and out as quickly possibly rather than to fix the issue, either that or their engineers have no idea of how to fix boilers. Oh and there is nothing they like more than prescribing (at the customers cost) a power flush on heating breakdowns.

First of all,their colleague came for first visit and said that he need some parts. Then he fixed next appointment for easter friday. Despite questionning, he ensured the appointement for friday so i stayed home for that. On Friday, no one came. Then after call, they gave other appointement 5 days later on thursday so again I took the day off and stayed at home. In afternoon, got call from technician that he received broken part so he will arrage for right part and fixed another appointment one day later on Friday (April 6th). Again took day off and stayed at home but no visit again. When called their office, they said sorry and exceptionally fixed appointement for saturday April 7th (any time during the day). Now sitting home in order to receive mr technician and then got one call from their office that the booking was made wrongly. Now need to fix another date. No idea what to do with such unimaginable bad service company........Further update on April 14th : On Saturday April 7th , finally customer service confirmed that they will call back on Monday April 9th  to confirm appointment date for any weekend but again no call till April 13th. Once again called them April 13th evening and agin explained all the issue. Put me on hold for 10 minutes in order to find appointement for saturday and they received reply that planning office is closed. Suggested me to call back on April 14th and explain again all the issue.. No idea if my machiene will be repaired ever or not..

It started over Easter and called first thing Tuesday morning. Wednesday I was told 8am - 6pm for access. No one came. Wednesday the representative couldn’t fix so said turn off the heating and I’ve booked someone for to tomorrow. No one came. I can’t shower, I’m cold as can’t put the heating on and have no hot water. I’ve called, mailed, etc and promises aren’t kept. Now n the top of it my kitchen needs redecorating and my health has suffered. I have previously had great service from them until my boiler service last year that I pay for in advance. I booked for September to be sure I would be ok through the winter. It was cancelled the day before and told don’t call back until at least February! I had to call them as an emergency as the boiler became faulty (needed a new seal). They need to shape up and keep appointments especially for the vulnerable.Still not sorted 3 days later.

1,"            AVOID AT ALL COSTSWe had a breakdown and called British Gas, I was offered a one off repair or the option to join their Homeplan.  I went for the Homeplan as the Boiler is ten years old and may require attention in the near future. The earliest they could make was 3 days time, so reluctantly we agreed.  On the Tuesday they were meant to arrive between 12 - 6, so my wife took a half day's holiday.  They did not turn up, but I received a phone call from an Indian man who had no grasp of the Queens English.  The jist of his conversation was that they were not coming and would have to reschedule.  After some persuasive conversation, he agreed to call that evening between 6 - 10.  At 10.10 I called again and they said he was on his way.  At 12pm he arrived, inspected the boiler and said I needed a fan and another engineer would be back tomorrow to fit it. As we work, it was agreed they would call 15 mins before arrival.  I got a call at 10.00 from the engineer who said he was outside my house, I explained he was meant to call as my wife worked 5 mins away, he said he would wait, so I called her. When she got there, he had gone onto his next job.  After a heated phone call to B.Gas, they agreed to ask him to call back.  When he got there, another one also turned up and they both decided my 10 year old Potterton was beyond economical repair, then cut off my Gas supply to the Boiler and advised a Salesman would call on Saturday to sell me a new Boiler. This behaviour resembled the Mafia. After receiving their quote (Most Expensive) and 5 others ranging from £3,100 - £1,900, I found a local Gas engineer who repaired the boiler for £500.00. Hence I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER USE BRITISH GAS AGAIN!!

Our boiler was installed by British Gas and as we have had numerous problems relating to the condensing pipe to the boiler decided we had no option but to stay with British Gas and pay their exorbitant price for Homecare.  My husband is on the ""vulnerable"" register and has recently come out of hospital following a major operation, I rang BG on Monday, 2nd April, as we have no hot water and was offered an appointment between 2pm and 4pm today.  I received a call at7.15pm last night cancelling this appointment and offered the next available appointment which is between 12 noon and 6 pm tomorrow.  I was told it was not possible to offer me a 2 hour slot so yet again I have to sit in waiting for BG to turn up if they don't cancel again in the meantime.  It seems that BG are totally indifferent to their customers, we still have an unfinished job from the beginning of last month when the condensing pipe had to be sawn off and as yet no idea when it will be repaired.  We have had cancellations and no shows and now they have gone over to an automated system on their customer service line making it very difficult to speak to a real person.If you are considering taking out a Homecare Plan with British Gas I suggest you think again as it is an overpriced inferior service which is not fit for purpose.  Also don't pay over the odds for British Gas to install your boiler thinking you will get a superior service, we did this and are now suffering the consequences.

The pipe that his water is coming from is also rusty.  Now i have had 2 services since i moved in to this house - not one engineer has mentioned this cup which seems odd to me, of they are doing a thorough check of the boiler why not ask why there is a cup underneath it? My guess is that they haven't done a thorough check but of course British Gas won't admit that and now I have to pay £60 to get someone to look at this? Absolutely shocking. The homecare policy is atrocious as it is - every year the price goes up and what do you get for it? An annual service which you get anyway - so why do prices keep rising?!

If your boiler is over 3 years old they will price your cover according to it's age. You may have an expensive boiler which NEVER breaks down, but they will charge a premium just in case it does, British Gas are happy to take your money as long as the risk of it breaking down is minimal. You can also expect a 15% annual increase whether you have used the service or not.

Eventually this was resolved the annual service was pushed back by British Gas for 6 months and again we started to have problems with the boiler I have had no hot water or heating since Wednesday one engineer came out said he fixed the issue and left only for the issue to be worse after he left. I called for an engineer again. When he arrive he walked straight through my back gate and not to the front door I then received a call on my mobile phone asking for him to discuss another job which I found very bizarre and rude. He said he was here due to a fault code which was not what the issue was the issue was a noise and vibration from the boiler and water leaking. He said he fixed the issue and all appeared fine until 15 minutes after he left the noise started again he was still in his van so we ran outside to get him. When he came back he was talking to me as if I was lying about the noise and said it didn’t make one when he was in the house for 20 minutes. And that there were no fault codes I tried to explain the issue wasn’t a fault code and that he hadn’t tested the boiler before going in to fix it and his response was “well I’ve sent the job back now and need to go somewhere else and to phone to book another appointment” the noise then came as he was going to leave and he told me it wasn’t the boiler even though it clearly was and nothing he could do now. So having heard the noise himself he then left the job knowing there wAs an issue. He was very rude and unhelpful. I called British Gas to come out again and the earliest appointment is in a weeks time.

I now have another appointment booked for a week’s time (and in the meantime no lights) and they cannot guarantee that at that appointment the engineer will have the parts ....... so I may have to start all over again.On another issue - sending an engineer to the home of an elderly (well, over 60) woman who lives on her own at 3am is not safe for either party.  I was lucky - he was very efficient and professional - but doing appointments in the early hours of the morning because they don’t have the staff and have to sub contract to people who also don’t have the staff to cover the work is irresponsible.

My parents were left without heating for weeks during extreme cold weather. In addition to this after being left for weeks being told a part was required for the boiler (which is easily sourced yet British gas seemed unable to obtain). When they finally came to fit the part they still left the heating system barely functioning and tried to charge my parents for more remedial work - even though they are home are customers and had the system fitted by them!They tried to complain by phone but it is obviously British gas does not care about their customers- they haven't called back and were advised they would only get a call back in 4 weeks!

I am sure there is a boiler sales/service pitch in here somewhere.UPDATEA second BG smart meter fitter has confirmed that he cannot install a gas smart meter where the purge point is inside the decorative casing of the  boiler because they do not have the appropriate level of the Gas Safe qualification. And he did hint at a boiler replacement .... no chance at my age! I have given up on this now although I am unable to read the existing meter . I wonder what will happen when they ask me to send them a reading?.PS It seems impossible to send BG an email. The system waits until you try to ""submit"" a message and then asks you to try again later. Why is the facility still offered on the website?

1,"            If you are coming off a dual fuel deal where you were getting one days free electric a week, you will have problems switching to another provider.  They have marked such customers as having an Economy 7 Meter.  You probably don’t have this type of meter, we don’t, and we have had to go onto their standard tariff.  We are told that the deal code will be updated on their database in the future and at that point, we will be able to transfer.  Underhand, we have been stopped from shopping around by their system and really we should be reporting this to the Ombudsman.  We have also advised Martin Lewis Money Exoert.  Shame on you British Gas.

We noticed he had actually ticked Checked Radiators box on the service form.Called BG explained what had happened with first engineer and ask for someone who knew about radiators to come out.The second engineer came on the 23rd February he was very efficient found the problem, no parts were involved just a bit of time needed.We have just received a bill for £60 for the second call out, which we disputed as it should have been sorted out by the first engineer under the yearly  service, just another way for BG to make more money.Needless to say they have lost another customer.When we complained we spoke to a customer service person called Micheal who said we would have had to pay even if the first engineer had fixed it, can’t quite work that one out as the service included radiators.As a good will gesture he would reduce the bill from £60 to £30.I came of the phone feeling very frustrated and ripped off

1,"            The 'annual' boiler service, for which we pay British gas nearly £400 a year on their cover plan, is now more than 6 months overdue! It was originally scheduled for  December, but was cancelled the day before with the excuse of emergency mains repairs required calling all engineers in to deal with a major problem in the New Forest. We were offered a date in February. When I protested, I was offered a 'goodwill' payment of £30 - plus an assurance that if we suffered a boiler malfunction in the intervening period we would be given priority. Fortunately we did not. I had to cancel the February appointment as we were attending the funeral of my aunt - & felt lucky to have to wait only 6 weeks for the next one - today, 27 March, between 8 a.m & 1 p.m. We were up bright & early waiting on the call from the engineer to tell us he would shortly be here! The phone rang at mid-day - to tell us that once again that due to emergencies, the engineer wasn't coming! After I had pointed out the service is now more than 6 months overdue, I was offered £65 compensation - apparently the cost of the service! Plus another 'goodwill' payment of £30! I refused to accept the payment & said I would like to make a formal complaint - so it has now been referred to Customer Services for mediation. We now have another appointment on 22 May - the BG cover ends on 03 June & we will certainly NOT be re-newing it!We have also had problems with the HomeServe plumbing cover - instead of the 24/7 response we paid for it was 5 working days before an engineer turned up to sort out flooding in our kitchen from a blocked drain.It worries us what response we'd get if we rang to report a gas leak - we'll probably be blown to Kingdom Come before BG respond!

British Gas engineer turned up the next day and told the tenants that it was a exiting issue at the time of cover purchase so not covered under the policy. I discussed with the customer service team who told me that I must have arranged a service visit after taking the contract to qualify for repairs under the cover. I didn't arranged such visit so policy is invalid and now the cost of repair is £160. Lesson learned.  Do not purchase cover from British Gas

No one can be able to cancel the direct debit and refund my money for the last 6 years. I have been calling none stop but no one can sort it out.

1,"            We have had a Home Care agreement with British Gas for a few years now. Almost every year we have had to re-organise the appointment to service the boiler because the engineer hasn't turn up when arranged. Apparently it is always our fault - the engineer couldn't find our house (we live on a normal street), nobody was in (we always were), the engineer phoned and got no reply (our mobile and landline phones were fully functioning / no voicemails were left) and so it goes on ....  This year has been so bad, we have decide to end our Home Care contract. As usual, the engineer did not arrive as arranged, and (with no apology from British Gas for wasting our time) a second appointment had to be made. Our boiler had been dropping pressure and we specifically asked the engineer to look into the problem. But after the service, the problem continued.. We arranged for the engineer to return, waited in for six hours and nobody turned up. When we phoned to ask what had happened, we were told that an engineer had been but there was nobody at the property. We had waited in the entire time. A second appointment was made, the engineer arrived, ordered some parts and confirmed an appointment for the following Monday. In the meantime, our boiler stopped working altogether, so no hot water, no heating ... not great for a family with two quite young children, plus very cold weather. On Monday nobody appeared. We phoned and were told there was no record of an appointment. Despite having no heating or water, we were told an engineer wouldn't be able to visit until the end of the week, and would then have to re-assess the problem, re-order the parts, and make yet another appointment to carry out the repair . After 50 minutes of being told that an earlier appointment wasn't possible, we ended the call, phoned back, spoke to a different person, and immediately got an appointment for the following day ... The engineer came, and within 2 weeks of servicing the boiler to his satisfaction, told us that  we would need a new one. So yet another appointment was made - this time we were told that our house was too big for a combi-boiler and we would need a different type, costing in the region of £8K. We have since had 2 independent assessments, and both have said that a large combi-boiler will be perfectly sufficient (at a cost of approximately £2.3K). Each year, we kept hoping that the service we received from British Gas would improve, but this year we have realised that it's just not going to happen. We're going to cancel our Home Care agreement, have a new combi-boiler boiler fitted by an independent gas engineer, and arrange for him to do any future services. I'm afraid our experience with British Gas has been dreadful, and we cannot recommend them in any way.

The British Gas rep who kept on saying that he wasn't a salesman (?) and just looked at my boiker in the airing cupboard and asked ""Do you want me to save you some time""?  I said yes and he said that the replacement cost for a basic boiler will start with the number 3 ..... i.e. £3,000 plus. We left it at that and he was gone again in less than 45 seconds flat.

I was in debit by £900, but with the help of British gas and the lovely person from customer service I was put on a plan and spread the cost over a few months. I was also told I could get regular texts to remind me to summit a meter reading, which I do through their easy app, and that had helped significantly reduce my debit. It has now cleared. I found them very helpful also, when explaining how much and where I had been using most of my electric. Fingers crossed I haven't had a bad experience yet.

Around 12.30 I received a call saying my engineer was running late but would be with me  around 1.30. 1.30 came and went 2pm came and went so I called BG who checked their system to say the engineer was en route to me. A further 20 mins went by and I had a bad feeling so rang them again to be told the engineer would not be with me as he had been moved to an emergency call out.  They couldn’t say whether he would be able to get to me today.  To be honest I flipped.  They hadn’t even bothered to call the next call out will be in 3 weeks time.  I have been a customer for 14 years and will be cancelling my contract and will never use their service again.  This is not the first time they have done this over the past 3 to 4 years this is a continual problem where they have let me down and not turned up having taken days off from work.

Normally a call is made for an appointment this never happened, so we phoned British Gas in January (2018) asking why no appointment, there was no clear answer but an appointment was made for middle of March 2018 (Service 5 months overdue). We received a call on 16th March asking if we would mind re scheduling the appointment due to their workload, I said no because service was already 5 months delayed. We had two further calls from British Gas in three days resulting in them saying we had no choice other than re schedule because of the severe weather conditions, which I don't accept. They also stated due to the renewal date of the contract, they have until next October to carry out the service. They are going to write and give us an appointment in June, which is no good to us as we are away on holiday for the month. This will probably result in almost a two year gap between boiler services, which is totally unacceptable, I am now looking for an alternative provider.

She sounded like a robot and refused to call my wife who manages the household. Her tone was ""if you don't like it, too bad"" and claimed that there was no supervisor for me to speak with, so if I insisted on complaining, I would need to go online (where no doubt it would be sat on/dealt with) by other BG robots.

However, no one ever took my amount for electricity!? I called early November to get this sorted and the girl I spoke to: refused to reset up my DD; told me I was wrong; to throw my information away; my amount for gas covered everything; BG already owed me £30; and most importantly I WOULD NOT GET A SURPRISE BILL! I argued for half an hour. Then, in February, my gas was not going out as well!?So I called, got a girl who suggested she'd get advise and call me back in a couple days. I heard nothing for over a week.So I called AGAIN, got a guy who told me a lock was randomly put on my account AND my DD was never set up correctly!He cancelled that and said I was to call in 24hrs to set it back up, okay. Then took my meter readings as I had a text for them!? Last DD received was December!? Informed me a private meter reading was taken in December!? Clearly BG knew about their balls up. And an imaginary bill was sent to me!?And I HAD TO PAY £337.57!!!!????I told him I'd call later to make a complaint as this was nonsense.Called back, girl gave me an email and would barely help me. Told me I had to email my complaint, not speak to anyone. Told me the same information as the girl in November!?I then called again a couple days later to SPEAK to someone about my complaint, the guy I spoke to was AMAZING. He worked it out by hand the usage to make sure I wasn't being done wrong anymore already, completely understood why I was so upset, lovely to talk to! And noted all I spoke to! He raised my complaint and gave me all the info I needed back in November! I also requested my November call to be listened to. He offered me £20 off, nope because I don't agree I should pay. Offered me £60, nope. Complaints guy didn't bother listening to my call, offered me £80 (£20 p short fall and additional £20..... There were about 5 short falls?). I requested £100 off, got told no and that it'll now go to ombudsman..... Because I'm declining your offer and that offer will disappear!? NOT A CHANCE! Stated I was not declining or accepting, it would be put on hold and I would decide after getting advise from them myself.Got told I could not do that, complaint would be escalated to them and I still had to set up a DD of my correct monthly amount and to pay BG dept and if I didn't I'd owe over £400 by the end of the month!? I am not meant to pay anything towards a disputed debt, YOUR COMPANY AND SYSTEM IS BODGED! I was FORCED into accepting £80. I have been bullied, threatened, harassed (with letters I got told I wouldn't get after my complaint was raised regarding the issue I made them aware of), given false information, being mislead, mis sold, given false promises, and my contract voided by BG to the pont I'm now paying £257.57 under duress.

We were in a contract with them for gas and have been for several years and before the contract ended we had a letter to say that our current contract is coming to an end and a new one from Jan 1st is ready for renewal with price increases of +81%!! What planet are they from! Really, lets hope they just auto-renew.haha, they think. With out of contract prices of +96% so we shopped around obviously for a better deal and have gone with SSE but even though we gave 3/4 weeks notice to end contract and joined SSE first week of Dec the switchover which was scheduled for first week of Jan was continiously delayed by British gas we were told and the switchover took 6/7 weeks in all which is crazy from the original estimate of 2/3 weeks. A £45 charge on account is made by British gas for payment that are not on time when they sent an invoice so we had little choose on paying and even though we explained to British gas what had happened they had little interest, as why they can't be bothered to answer customers messages on here. Why would British gas do a switchover on time when we are leaving and they can make alot more money from us, well we certainly will not be using them again and telling everyone of our experiences. I noticed they do not reply to Trustpilot reviews so what does that tell you :(

However service has got much worse and during the recent cold period (which everyone it seems except BG knew was coming) I could not get through to them on the telephone for several days to arrange for their engineer to visit and repair. I therefore had to pay for a local company to repair.I shall not be renewing my cover with BG and shall be using local heating engineers from now on.

There was a problem with my gas with my current supplier & rather than notify me BG just cancelled the gas & switched the electric. It wasn't until over a month later when I contacted them to find out when the gas was starting that I was told.Eon my current suppliers sorted the issue quickly, but since then trying get to BG for to transfer my gas has been frustrating & costly. Their customer service advisers can't be bothered to actually read the complaint & are patronising. Then when pulled up on this chose to totally ignore any further correspondence.I started the switch 2 1/2 months ago & have got no-where. The regulator is my next point of contact. They are money grabbing & should never have switched one without the other that is not what I signed up to.Also the first payment came out of my account on a different date to what the direct debit had been set up for and without any prior notice.Do yourself a favour & give this rip-off un-customer focused company a wide birth

I did my practical and fault finding successfully but was later told that the person who was to speak to me is busy and that they cannot offer me the position whilst another candidate who happens to be English was taken straight in to speak to that very same person and was offered the job. To me, this is pure prejudice and racism for not giving me the job. I don't recommend British Gas to anyone either as an Energy supplier or as an employer plus their guarantee that people take out is NULL as they do not vouch their word. It's the worst company to use and I highly don't recommend them so be aware.

Cancelled product and engineer visit in disgust then complained. Several weeks later I was informed that as they had booked an engineer to visit and I had cancelled they would not refund any of the money I had paid into the scheme. I lost my engineer visit through choice but think a partial refund as a good will gesture would have been a fair outcome for what I consider inadequate service for an expensive product.

In September 2017 I contacted BG to arrange a annual service for my central heating bolier and gas fire, we are paying over £35 per month for this service !!!! and have held a contrct sine 2010. I was told that they were exceptionally busy and had no availability until January the 8th 2018, this date was reluctantly accepted. On January the 7th BG contacted me to cancel the service  ""due to exceptional demand for breakdowns"" an alternative date was offered, March the 6th 2018. To-day (March the 5th 2018 ) I havre received notification that BG will not be able to attend due to ""high breakdowns"" On contacting BG they have now offered to attend on May the 14th 2018, some 9 months after my first call.After much discussion via text ( they appear to not want to talk to customers) they have offered a refund of £130 because they have not carried out a service since 2/09/2015 as they believe they have no responsibility to chase the customer to complete planned service work.It appears that BG are happy to draw you into a service contract at a low monthly rate then increase these charges annually over time, they accept no responsibility to manage the service contract, they treat existing loyal customers as a hindrance, who can be pushed back from planned and paid for service. When we eventually spoke to BG there was no empathy, no effort to resolve this issue and a attitude of take it or leave it.Perhaps if they were to complete their contracted services that they have received income from, they would have less breakdowns to attend, prevention being better that cure.

As I could not stay without heating or hot water all that time, I called a local company and they came and repaired it immediately. Funny thing is the breakdown had nothing to do with freezing pipes, but it was due to a water trap inside the boiler that have never been cleaned during the routine services and was totally blocked with a grey muddy sediment. Once before my boiler had malfunctioned after the service visit, when the engineer altered every single setting and left without testing if the boiler was still working. If I cannot trust the engineers that service the boiler and cannot expect them to turn up in an emergency, why on earth am I paying them for?

They sent a plumber in who confirmed what the problem was and that they would order the part. Roll on a month of being ignored by British Gas and the plumbers I eventually get a call to say the parts arrived. The plumber come back and ""fixed it"".  We carried on using the other shower and yesterday decided to give the shower that had been fixed a go. One day later I've got water pouring through my kitchen ceiling in exactly the same place which unfortunately trips my electrics.I call British Gas emergency number only to be told by three different customer services agents that, ""we don't cover shower leaks"", I pointed out that 1) how could they know what policy I had as they hadn't looked me up and 2) patently they do cover showers because they sent a plumber twice before! I explained my sorry situation pointing out their plumber seems to have made matters worse only to be told that this wasn't an emergency. After arguing that water pouring through a ceiling and tripping electrics was exactly the kind of situation they claim they insure under my policy, eventually, the agent accepted that 1) they do actually insure (funny given that's what they charge me for) and 2) it was an emergency. I was promised a plumber would be with me today. Guess what.... no plumber.So in summary if you take out a British Gas Home Care policy you can be sure you'll obtain the following benefits: you'll get to send British Gas money every month, you'll get 'helped' by customer services agents that haven't got a clue what they are actually talking about, you'll be promised emergency care from someone that probably won't show up and if they do send someone they'll use a company with the motto 'dam busters, after us cones the flood"".My advice, plebty of other companies I certainly won't be renewing and I'm minded to sue for breach of contract and return of the monies paid to date.

It was Impossible to get through on the phone as British Gas decided to turn their phones off,  so the only way to book an engineer was to do it online.  However, online booking confirmed the earliest appointment was the 22 March (over 3 weeks away). I appreciate that due to the weather that its much busier than normal but 3 weeks without hot water or central heating with young children is just not possible. There was absolutely no way to contact British Gas to establish why it would take so long or plead my case, so I tried messaging through facebook, all I received was a generic message saying they couldn't do anymore and If I didn't like it, I should raise a complaint.  British gas have totally misrepresented the  service it provides with home cover, I pay over 300 a year for what exactly? no hot water or heat for three weeks and I all get is a I don't give a toss generic template response from them. Absolutely awful service, I will be raising with trading standards and will be progressing a complaint regarding British Gas' mis-selling of this product and their terrible service all the way to the Ombudsman, perhaps a £500 case fee charge from the ombudsman service, will make them take a bit of notice. Those in charge of British Gas should be sacked, They only make decisions to line their own pockets and really don't care about the service,  They recently shut one of their call centres in Oldbury with the loss of 649 jobs, But in total they have cut 7000 service facing jobs in 2017, I cant post the link but just google the article in the telegraph for more information.   All the fat cats executives are laughing at the rest of us whilst they are making millions in bonuses from cutting jobs.  How can people be rewarded for performing so poorly in this crisis. Yes the weather is a factor but the people at the top and their decisions to cut back on call centre's  and the service British Gas provides are the real reason for the problems most people are encountering.  Its disgusting that the vile individuals running British Gas will continue to carry on in their jobs and will just blame it all on the weather.

I shall be making a few calls on monday morning to other providers and to solicitors as long as my health permits seeing as how we have had no heating or hot water all day and I am now finding it difficult to breathe.

1,"            Really disappointed.Recently moved house after selling ours in September. Paid final bill to BG and closed account in October. No issues.Then all of a sudden British gas have now opened a new account for our old address in my partners name without his consent even though we have not lived there in over 4 months and are nothing to do with the property anymore, and are sending us somebody elses bill which they have put our name on. We don't live there! We moved out in october, the bills are dated november, dec, jan, feb of this year it's nothing to do with us! All the bills are 'estimated' readings and the new owner of the property is  liable, not us. So how on earth they think they can send us bills for energy we have no used for an address which we don't live at is ridiculous.Phoned up in Dec, Jan and Feb only to be told to 'call back another time' because the team werent available to deal with it. Told to email instead but then told they don't have an email address for that specific team. Emailed the general address no reply, emailed ceo, no reply.They don't seem to care that they have opened an account fraudulently in my partners name and continue to send us bills for energy they havnt supplied, at an address at which we don't live.British gas, sort yourselves out. We have given you the new owners names and you were so uninterested, seems you'd rather bill the wrong people. My partner very stressed out and upset to be receiving payment demands for somebody elses property and despite promising to cancel the account and 'annotating' notes on it to say it's nothing to do with us BG still send us payment demands and think it's an acceptable way to treat customers. Glad we left, but shocking that they still can't leave us alone still.

1,"            Appalling boiler Homecare cover. My appt was cancelled after they should have been there and I was told the next one was a week away. Considering the freezing temperatures this is awful. The insurance isn't worth the paper it's written on. Their phone line is dire, I suspect I'd still be hanging on waiting. The online complaint template didn't work, presumably overrun with complaints. It all seems to be a profit making exercise for British gas, not enough staff, awful phones and certainly not efficient on line service. I'd never trust British gas again

1,"            After a previous poor experience where I was left without heating for 11 hours and when someone said they were coming, hadn't and I had fallen under the 'vulnerable' category at the time, I secured some compensation and was told the amount would be paid into my account.                                 It was when I was answering questions about the situation to a friend that I recalled that I hadn't noticed the amount having gone into my account and that I would check. So upon checking, I noticed that it hadn't, so I called them to ask about it, and whilst I do appreciate it is a very busy time for them, I understand they are using other people and the guy kept saying he was not British Gas, but then why are you answering the phone? He was saying that the whole of the team is dealing with the issues around the weather, which I just think is a cop-out really so I said ""aren't you an energy company"" and there is such a thing as zero hours contracts and it should have been provided for. He then put the phone down on me. He said he was from Hyde or something like that and had a Scottish accent. I voiced my opinion, but was not rude and didn't get personal, or swear.I then called Customer service. How can you not have a customer service? Even the number where you call when you say you want to leave? No-one. I mean a lot of this was foreseen and they just don't want to spend money.  I will call them next week. I think they should take the name 'British' off because it raises expectations of being a national institution, which they are not behaving as though they are.

So I rang BG again 3 hours later,  shivering with the cold and trying to keep my husband in bed suffering all the tantrum one gets from dementia patients. I was told my first telephone call had not been logged!!  However that young lady was extremely helpful and said I was a priority case and an engineer would be there as soon as possible, certainly before midnight.  I cannot fault the engineer in anyway,  absolutely first class,  he treated me as if I was his grandmother, helped me upstairs on my stairlift since I was shivering so much I couldn't get my arthritic cold hands to work the controls.  He  knew exactly what to do with  the frozen pipe outside, after going out to my garden shed and to get my tree lopper to cut the pipe with  although he rang round for help from those engineers that were ladder trained, everyone was obviously busy due to the extreme weather conditions.  He explained to me that the pipe would leak a bit but later BG would repair it if I explained what he had done.  This man Harvey Rampton was a credit to BG and I just cannot thank him enough.  Such a cheerful man, certainly turned my tears into laughter and within  half an hour or so I had heat again.    Thank you Harvey Rampton.  employee no. 57044

1,"            My 86 year old mother's boiler conked out yesterday morning. This shouldn't be a problem as we pay plenty for Homecare 400. However, she was calling the proper number but getting a  message that the said that number wasn't accepting calls!We drove 40 miles of fairly snowy roads to reach her. She was correct, the number (0800 048 1000) wasn't accepting calls. We tried an alternative - 0333 200 8899. That one just connected and disconnected straight away. We tried the '5 quick checks' shown on the British Gas website to no avail, so gathered up my mother and took her home with us, with an online booking for an engineer to come out next Wednesday (5 days time). There was no mechanism to let them know my mother was a vulnerable person - perhaps they could do better than 5 days for something where we pay for a premium service (which we are then charged an extra £60 excess call out charge)Recommendations for British Gas...1. When booking a repair engineer online, have an option to communicate that it is for a vulnerable person2. Include British Gas Homecare customers in your Priority Services Register for vulnerable persons. It shouldn't just be for supply customers.3. The 5 quick checks didn't include checking for a frozen condensate pipe - get them updated pdq to reflect conditions. Google is my friend; some online research suggests this is the problem for my mother's boiler and many others3. Obviously, don't reduce call centre staffing at just the point that demand is likely to be at a peak. It's not often I agree with the Daily Mail but today's report is spot on for our experience!!

Got told today they had to rebook it after after I had called them. Was advised they tried to call me. Only missed call I had was from a private number and I don't answer them as they are usually junk. I wanted a full refund on the homecare service I had with them as I have yet to receive any service.

Considering the demand they must of had I’m really impressed with what they managed to achieve and thankful our heating has been sorted in a quick a time as they managed!

Over 15 years we have paid around £2160 and not needed the service once, yet when we do British Gas have failed us. We were left with no choice but to get an independent engineer as no heating or hot water was becoming too dangerous to my health to risk waiting.  The local engineer came within 4 hours, he is suffering the same effects as British Gas but has made allowances and had a contingency plan. Extra expense to ourselves but my health is more important. To add insult to injury the number to cancel the policy is constantly engaged. Would definitely not recommend Homecare to anyone, especially someone who is vulnerable.

I couldn't get my boiler to stop working keeping my heating and hot water continuously working!!  I know that that may be a relief for those of you that have no heating at all but I am concerned that this is not only going to cost so much money but overheat everything.

So yesterday I rang all the numbers you could think of, stayed on the line for well over an hour, emailed the complaints department and tried ringing them today.  Still no response!  An absolute waste of money for a Company who say that they care  and are there 24/7. Not only that but if you call before 12 noon they say they will come the next day.  Please accept my sympathy for those people that have no heating at all.  Oh and the earliest that they can come is next Thursday!!!!  I pay over £29 per month for this service.  So poor.

Arranged engineer appointment online but this means waiting for two days. I pay a lot for this service (Homecare 400) which has failed me. Complaints line permanently engaged (and no access by email?) Not surprised.Friday 2 March. Phoned again at 8.00 am. Line closed!Need to cancel this insurance and find a reliable service. Any thoughts anybody?

1,"            Our boiler didn't work this morning and its -7 C outside. Its the same fault not fixed some 3 times. So, British Gas is not making enough money and now I know how they plan to save it! This is done by cutting back on the supposed 5 star service so that you only get a  1 star when you have paid them thousands of pounds over 20+ years.I wake to find no heating and then phone for emergency breakdown help at 6am and have to listen to dreadful music until I hear a click at 8am and the phone goes dead! Oh, thought it was a 24 hour service but guess no - they must have just clocked in at 8am. I then try several times throughout the day and its just engaged or dreadful music. They suggest its better to book on line and I do so out of desperation. Guess what I can get EMERGENCY help in 6 days time !!!!!!!!  So I book it and proceed to try and get established on their radar. Through the day I phone but nobody picks up - how does a multimillion pound company fail so badly? Why in these extreme weather circumstances is there no explanation or backup plan? Its now 24 hours later and I am able to get through and the auto-voice says something like 13 hours wait for help! ?????? I cant believe it and ....what is this? ...they then say we will call you back if you press in you phone number. Well is there anybody at home in British Gas? This is deplorable and so I too have to make a review along side all the other people here that have not got what they paid for.  Its an outrage when you read down this list British Gas should be ashamed of themselves.

1,"            I was told by british gas they will put a new smart meter in my home as it is better n more convenient. And yes it was ideal at first till one day not to long after having it installed the smart meter no longer wanted to too up via card or app so I of course called them they arranged an engineer nothing happened. So every time I top up now I have to manually put in the 20 digit numbers one by one every time it needed topping up. I called British gas explain I have pregnant n the meter is on the floor not easy to get to especially I was getting bigger n bigger in my pregnancy n nothing happened. So 9 months has gone of me calling them complain about it I finally had enough. I threatened to leave. Then all of a sudden they 're arranged for another engineer to come n try fix it n if they cannot fix it they will put an old meter in. Ok so the engineer can out on Wednesday 28 February me busy with my baby I couldn't keep any eye on what he was doing all I heard from engineer is that he has replacereolced the meter back to the old pay as u go meter n that my meter has just got emergency.!!!!!!!the card will take a few days to arrive. He said I can call up British gas n get them to Arrange for me to collect a card from a store near my house. So today Thursday from 11 am I had done nothing but call all the numbers I could possibly call from British gas n for what ever reason could not get gold of anyone from any of he numbers  so after 2 hours of trying plus juggling a baby I decided to try the chat line. Finally got through to a person I demanded someone to call me back asap as it is minus freezing outside n I was afraid to run out of gas with a baby n three other children that suffer from asthma. So now if explained what's happened to he lady on phone she then give me an rti  number to go get a rti card from a shop close to my house. So later that evening after picking up kids from school n feeding them we hen go out to the shop asking for a card, the shop does not have any so we tried another one same problem went to a few other in the snow blizzard with my baby n three other kids in the car. Two hours it took me to get round the snow blizzard n traffic. I finally found a shop that had he card n they didn't not have a clue what to do with it. 😡so I went back to thenfire shop closer to my house with the card to get them to sort without for me and they tried topping up the card using the rti number n the shop says the number doesn't exist. So I had no choice back yo go back home with my kids empty handed. Once settling the kids I had to call British gas ended up waiting 38 mins in phone till someone actually answered the phone to speak to a man that did not care bout what just happened to me n my kids n said well did they not give u a text with instructions to give to the shop. I said no all I was given was a rti number n was told to give it over to the shop n I can top up from there. He goes ok so I will send u a text which u need to bring to the shop for them go follow. By this time I am absalulty disgusted wit the service n just lost my temper n said to home u expect me to go out with my four children again I n the snow because ur company can't do their job right I n the first place. No sympathy from this agent who just turned around n said well madam the issue is solved now n if ur still not happy u can file a complaint.!!!!!!!!!! That's it that's all u can say to me after the day i have had because of their lack of training to the staff from British gas.i have no words to explain this company all I have to say is if u are thinking of joining them dnt it's a big mistake

In the past they have called me up to remind me but not this time, the first i hear of it is a red letter telling me they will pass on my debt to a debt collection agency unless i pay, i pay immediately, then when looking at my bill i see they have charged me extra on bill for not paying on time. Try to use the contact us form to get someone to call me to discuss issues and guess what that form even though filled out correctly is not working and will not send.Red letter also states that i will find details about what to do if i cant pay, getting help with your debt, your credit rating, how to pay....guess what that is also missing, so no help whatsoever, thanks British Gas

1,"            Dreadful experience. 5 engineer visits over 8 days and tonight no heating and hot water again. First engineer said nothing wrong and left. Second engineer changed a valve. Third engineer ordered parts and left. Fourth engineer said he was only able to install Hive (and I already have it)! And fifth engineer returned with the parts but said he didn’t need them as it was only “blocked”?? Tonight same problem occurs, no heating or hot water. Been on hold for one hour and 57 mins and still no one picking up the call. Chest infection and asthma and no heating.  Thanks you must be the worst company in history. Oh and took £99 from me and set me up with a £28 pm homecare plan. I’d like a refund please as I will have to get an independent professional. Beyond abysmal. And no I don’t care about the dusting of snow we’ve had causing your phone delays. The Swiss and the Canadians must be in fits. Oh and by the way I was told to expect a £30 compensatory award for your failure to provide me with a functioning heating and hot water system. Still doesn’t show in my bank but the £99 you took does!

And when you get on hold, you are just on hold for hours on end...without ever getting through to anyone. I managed to ring another one of their office numbers...which had a message on that ""they had closed their offices today because of the bad weather"". Seriously, a company that is meant to look after heating and other appliances decides to shut their offices when it gets too cold??? Today, they have lost another customer. As soon as I can get through to them, I will cancel my homecare agreement with them. And I have called out a local heating engineer for our boiler problem. Hopefully he can get the boiler fixed.

1,"            Unfortunately inherited British gas when I moved into my new house. Called up to arrange direct debit and opened a new account under my name. Agreed monthly amount and left call all set up. 2 months later, bailiff letter on my door saying I owe them £400.... called up and for some reason they had cancelled my direct debit and sent bailiffs round!!!! They apologized profusely and said they would call me back to set up the account again - never called back. Since then I’ve received 3 letters, all on the same day, all with different amounts. I’ve decided to switch supplier and now they’re trying to charge me an extra £50 for switching when I was in a contract!!!!! Absolutely laughable, I’m beyond fuming and never want to have to deal with them again. I’m on hold with them as I’m writing this, I think he’s put me on hold and done a runner!!! Worst service ever. He also told me he would lose his job if he waived the £50 fee, not something you expect to hear from a large company like British gas....

It took ages to get through but eventually they agreed to send an engineer out today, March 1st, between 12.00 and 6.00pm.At about 3.30pm they rang to say that they were not able to come today but instead would send an engineer   out on WEDNESDAY 6TH MARCH, a whole week after I reported the breakdown. What is the point of paying out about £250.00 a year for service like that.I got hold of an emergency plumber and paid £230.00 to get my heating fixed and I will be expecting British gas to reimburse me. I would urge others in the same position to do the same.Both the British gas customer  service numbers were unobtainable! I wonder why.Big Al

The only phone number I could find on docs or website doesnt  connect which was a poor start. Then found the option to book a call on line but earliest date is a week away! Load of comments about how busy they are due to cold weather etc. but  I expect better from British Gas. I thought paying their premium rates would result in a premium service. Would have made more sense saving the monthly fee and paying a local reliable tradesman when needed.

Its criminal that in this weather, that is their response and level of service.  You pay for insurance for piece of mind and British Gas have offered me none.

So I'm now out of pocket, with a unserviced for 2 years boiler and it's -5 outside so if it breaks down now I'm screwed. Very poor service. Say they'll call back in 3-5 days. Don't.

He couldn't stop saying that it was chargeable!He said quite aggressively what do you want do do? I said I wont be doing anything until you give me a quote.He back tracked a bit and said oh yes, I'll give you a quote.He showed me the fault and said it was the whole sump that had to be replaced, because you cant buy separate parts. I pointed to the sump clean out cover and said isn't it just the gasket? Ah no he its gone on the screws, funny I think,  they're captive threads that arent on the inside of the seal. He gets all excited phoning various mates of his who are also British gas engineers asking them if they could do him a job. He then phones the job into the call center, gets all stroppy with the operator because they tried to put the job through to a different engineer.My wife wanted the job doing so I'd agreed, he remembered some other gaskets we needed, by now the cost was up to £195.He was arrogant, sexist, racist and cocky.Got me to sign paperwork quickly, without going through it, when I checked it said he'd checked radiators, valves pipes etc. In reality he asked me how many rads I had, that was it.He was at my house over 2 hours and never did a thing except take the cover off the front of the boiler, spend a long time talking on the phone and kept going to his van.I later got a second opinion from another gas engineer, you can get parts, a brand new cover and gasket for the grand sum of £11A thoroughly horrible experience.The next day I phoned to complain, cancel my cover and the other engineers appointment. You could tell the operator wasn't interested as they'd heard it a thousand times before.I wanted to put in a complaint but this wasn't the 'right department' but a manager would phone from the field service team within 48 hrs.You guessed it, no phone call.You had your chance you blew it.I'm a mechanical engineer with an understanding of these things so have a good idea when somebody is trying to rip you off.I worry for the elderly or others who think they are getting a genuine service from British Gas.Do yourselves a favour don't bother with these conmen, find yourself a reputable local guy.Mr M Foy

Our Valiant boiler was losing pressure and after 4 months of coming out, replacing parts and then stating it was our underfloor heating leaking, they called out Dynarod who gas pressurised the system, only to tell us and BG it's the boiler not the underfloor. They replaced the heat exchanger and 40 minutes later water was pouring out the front of the boiler. Dried it out and left for a while, 4 weeks later and on Tuesday morning the electrics have packed up and no heating, we had to call an emergency plumber out to diagnose the problem as BG can't get to us until Thursday.  They were due today Thursday and rang at 9am to cancel and rebook next Wednesday! So in the coldest week of the year we have no heating for over a week. We are now talking to a local company about just replacing the boiler which is only 5 1/2 years old and having them support us.

The website page is not reliant on the weather, people are I accept, but for a massive company like British Gas not having any contingency in place, bearing in mind we all knew the beat from the east was on its way is unforgivable, because they have put venerable peoples lives in danger as this cold can kill especially when you have no heating at all.British Gas I will be holding you to account, we will source another firms service to repair the heating and we will pass all the costs plus our additional costs for loss of time trying to sort this out as I am at work and claiming this from British Gas....

1,"            And I am being generous giving them one star. Anyone thinking of going with British gas homecare then don't. What a complete joke. Each year they put your premiums up and keep postponing your appointment to service your boiler due to high demand. Now when I actually have a breakdown because they haven't serviced it because they have cancelled the appointment three times the number you are supposed to call says they aren't accepting calls right now. This is unacceptable especially when they charge £300 a year for the cover and they won't even answer calls. I have also been online and it says their email is unavailable at this time.

1,"            We have a 7 day old child and boiler broke down over 24 hours ago, when I first called the guy I spoke completely disregarded this and said earliest they could come out to us was Friday. I then called back to make a complaint and they promised someone would be with us yesterday by 6pm no one showed and no contact until 10:38pm to tell us we can wait for an engineer to arrive. Ten minutes later I had a call back from them telling us that had been  cancelled and would have to wait until till today. So I woke this morning to find a few missed calls from an engineer who tried to arrive at 2am though I was told he wasn't coming. Now I try to get through and they disconnect me. I have never been so angry at a service to which we pay insurance for before and still no contact from them.

1,"            Start: Thursday, 1st March 2018Well, where to begin...  oh wait, I don't have to, British Gas have been rubbished half to death already.  Same old, same old I'm afraid.  Cancelled appointments, 'no show' engineers.  -4.5C outside and no heating / hot water, they are not answering the telephone, the website is down so I cannot do it online, system service cancelled twice and as I'm not in the UK all the time, when they cancel an appointment as they did last year, I'm not home for them to pitch up 2 months later, I have to wait 5 or 6 months longer!  So, short version, they should have serviced my boiler last September (2017), the couldn't do it without 6 weeks notice (silly me thinking I could book a service a month up front, how stupid of me).  As I was out of the UK until February 2018, they said they do it in February.  I'm self employed, work away from home so I set the day in my diary and they don't bother to turn up, no call, no text, no email, just don't turn up.  I call, oh says the disinterested young man, we left a voicemail for you yesterday.  Really Mr disinterested young man?  I had my service provider turn off my voicemail 4 years ago as I don't like it, so BG, that was pretty impressive.  I called 'Customer Relations' after the email I sent bounced and in the end, found a working email and copied in a high ranking BG manager.OK, so I've been writing this for a while between phone calls and I finally managed to get logged in online.  I have also managed to book an appointment and have had email confirmation!  That bit only took just over an hour hahaha!   They have marked my account with 'Do Not Cancel' appointments since the last debacle, time will tell if that has any effect, especially as they should be pitching up on Monday (4 days away even though I have no heating / hot water and it's now -4C outside). If I'm not in prison for hunting down and holding the whole of the 'HomeCare' department hostages, I'll try to come back and update this with the result.  Personally, I'm not holding my breath (mostly because I'm shivering in the cold and can't).  Hm, I can feel a 'Watchdog' email coming on...  EDIT: I forgot to say, the lovely British Gas forced me to put Debit card details in before I could book the appointment to the tune of £60.  OK, I'm  very lucky in that £60 is OK for me but what about people that are tight for money until the end of the month (It's the 1st today and for some it's another 4 weeks to payday)?  Presumably, they'd have to wait for 4 more weeks until they could even book an appointment and they wait 4 or 5 days until BG will pitch up!  Crazy!UPDATE: Friday, 2nd MarchNot being happy sitting in the cold with no heating / hot water, I found a local Gas Safe plumber that was able to fix my issue on the phone yesterday after 2 questions, turns out the frost stat in the loft was too cold!  So, I try to cancel my appointment with British Gas.  Laughable is probably the only appropriate comment I can make just now.  First, I log into my account online, that's no good because they want to cancel me existing annual service that I don't want cancelled.  So, I have tried about a dozen BG telephone numbers, they either don't get answered, time out or the nice British Gas lady tells me all lines are currently busy and call back later, email is 'unavailable' whatever that means and chat tells me there is no one available to chat to.  My dilemma is this:  If I cancel the 'emergency' appointment I have for Monday, they will also cancel my aforementioned annual service visit which was booked for April 10th.  Well, as it turns out, I don't want that.  I want my service visit to be left where it is because I'm not available from April 14th for 12 weeks.  If I let them pitch up on Monday, I have to pay a £60 call out fee.  I don't want that either.  Am I being unreasonable?  I don't think so.  I'll keep this updated as I can...

The plumber had to freeze pipes to remove the old boiler.I never did have a reply from British gas about it , just a few "" we'll look into it...""Every so often they ring and try to offer it to me , I relay the above story , they tell me it's different now , all the engineers are in house ( which judging from other reviews , they're not ) i tell them "" not interested , fool me once....""I also experienced the delays too , i had an oven break and was told no engineer available , i phoned a local engineer , who arrived that afternoon and fixed it in an hour . I had the boiler go down and was told it would take ten days as no one was available , but in the meantime would i like to increase the level of my homecare package ( they still had no one available - so what would have been the benefit of the extra expense?? ) Nope , i have now used a local plumber for a number of years and the level of service and response is 10/10 , even came out Christmas day when we had a leak - that's the level of service BG should be delivering, that is what you pay for , and it is how to keep customers!

1,"            Just terrible. Don’t waste your money on the homecare. They provide broad appointment windows meaning you waste whole days waiting for their disinterested engineers. I was told three weeks to look at a washing machine issue.  All of the people doing the actual work belong to third party companies dyno plumbing etc so they really don’t care about the outcome of your job as they get paid for attending appointments not resolving issues.

I think  you should  get cover with a  company who can actually do the work themselves  not one that blindly subcontracts your account.

Called up both companies to sort out. I was unable to create an online account as I had used British gas around 5 years ago with the same email address. Waited two weeks to fix this. Once my online account was created I noticed that both my readings were estimations.Asked for the estimations to be fixed. Apparently, their email system was down so I didn't receive the email that asked for my confirmation. I replied very carefully to the second email to confirm that they could change my opening account.Just received my first bill and still have an estimate on my electricity portion of the bill.This has been going on since the 20th December 2017.

The times I have hit that call centre things have been much better.  Main Complaints.1. Appointments are not kept.  They are regularly moved on the day.  I had a single appointment bounced 4 times.  Once with a warning call and 3 without.  The reason was the same each time.  Higher risk people in my area.  I actually understand that, but the number of times was too high2. Engineers promising to be back with parts, and not actually coming back so you start your process again.  The old 'engineer said no one was home' if I had not been painting the front door that day I might have believed them.3. Billing.  I paid over the phone to set up the service in the first place.  I have a direct debit set up with them.  All of a sudden I get threatening letters that I will be taken to court and reported to a debt collector if I didn't pay £99.00 owed.  (nothing on the letter to say what the £99.00 was for, and no instructions of how to pay it)  When I called it was explained British Gas had an issue with their billing and didn't bill correctly a bunch of invoices. The people on the phone were fine, sorted most things out, but I have had the service for 3 months now and nothing has gone right, I would rather pay double and have things just work.  I am looking now what my options are.  I have been told that I will be charged to leave inside the first 12 months.. to be honest that just sums them up.  Fail to deliver the service promised and then threaten you to stay.  I may just pay it and leave and as a result never come back.I can state I was offered £30 off the £99.00 to make up for the poor service.  I didn't accept it.  I didn't call to get money off.  If I owe the £99 I will pay it.  I would rather they use it to improve the service.

I contacted them to notify them of changing tenancy & here started my misery. This saga is not over yet unfortunately.When I called them, they advised to send documents in an email. First, there is a limitation on emails capacity & one has to send divide documents over multiple emails to pass through. Then, I had to phone them to confirm they received my emails. They gave a deadline of 10 days to deal with my issue, however, this was stretched to 4 weeks because they have a backlog of work. One at the end checked my papers & found them insufficient. Instead of phoning me or emailing me to request further evidence. They brilliantly decided that the issue is closed with no further action. When I called them again they started the entire process from scratch, back to sending multiple emails. Now called again to find out my emails did not pass through & I've to send them again.This service is a complete waste of time & efforts, it seems they never care about what they do or what their customers may feel.I can't wait to switch the account to leave them to another supplier.Please anyone thinks of choosing this company, read all these reviews first.

Had appointment in December 2017 for annual service which got cancelled an hour prior to appointment using the excuse of engineers being re directed to emergency call outs, which initially I had some sympathy with. Then came the annoying part, next available slot 23rd February 2018. I called the complaint line and was offered £30 compensation and a 2 hour time slot for next appointment on 23rd February. I asked why the boiler had not been serviced since September 2016 and was told reminders no longer sent out, and as long as they did a service anytime during the contract year that was acceptable. Also note that no compensation was offered by the initial caller cancelling the original appointment. Fast forward to 23rd Feb, and I get a call in the morning cancelling the appointment for same reasons and before, no compensation offered, just another date in April. Call the complaint line, get another £30 and a new 2 hour slot appointment for 19th April. This will mean I will have only got 3 services in 4 years, it goes without saying I wont be renewing.

2,"            This is about ''British Gas HomeCare'' specifically.  We have been customers for 5 years.  We took out the full package, cover for boiler, radiators, toilets, electrical, kitchen appliances.  Not cheap but really useful when you have an emergency.  But NOT really useful if they keep cancelling the appointments.  The last 3 call outs have all been cancelled. One time without any notice, the other times with only 24 hours notice or same-day notice.  The reasons are usually the same, spikes in demand, staff shortages, over-running work on that day, etc.  One time we had a toilet repair that took 5 months, due to parts not being ordered and miscommunication between the plumber and his office.  I have managed to get my monthly premiums reduced slightly as a result of the ongoing unreliability, but the time is coming where I will probably end up going with one of their HomeCare competitors.Best advice?  Try it for a year, you might have better luck than we did. Otherwise, shop around and don't be persuaded by their goodwill gestures.

Also booked a drain check for the same day... they didn't turn up in the A.M. either so I cancelled the drain visit! Cancelled my contract via phone the same day (9/2/18), they promised to send me confirmation of this... but have I received anything?  Erm nope..!!!! >:-(   One more DD to pay and I'm out of it!Homecare300 at £33+ per month (central heating+drains) surely it would be cheaper to save around £400 p.a. and pay for a proper service I think.AVOID BRITISH GAS!!!

1,"            How do I  get a proper contract of service for my boiler? Because Corgi had not come out to do a service for 18 months and my attempts to arrange an engineer three times had produced no appointment, I changed to BG in November.  My first boiler inspection was then arranged - for 1st February this year.  The engineer arrived, pointed out that the pressure in the system was high and adjusted it.  The next day I found the pressure was dropping to danger levels and let water in.  This happened again and again on a daily basis.  I phoned to get the engineer back and was given an appointment ""between 8 am and 1 am"" on 19th.  I waited from 8 am and at 12:15 received a call from BG to cancel.Between them these two businesses have the boiler insurance market stitched up.  They are as bad as each other.

Our boiler was due to be serviced by 24|7 on 15th Feb 10 month's after they said they were going to service it by the way ! After another episode with them I cancelled my policy as they debited my account in Feb after telling me the premium would be waived Feb and Mar as a gesture of goodwill for the trouble I had experienced.My wife waited until late afternoon on the 15th Feb and then phone the engineer to be told that as my plan was cancelled they would not be servicing the boiler.I called BG around 5pm Thursday and explained my boiler was broken down and after being given my options I was told that an engineer could be round the next afternoon.The engineer was helpful polite and professional and had our boiler sorted in no time.I would like to take this opportunity to thank the engineer for arriving very promptly and repairing the boiler and for his courteous manner and professionalism.I appreciate this is not always peoples experience but on this occasion it is nice to give praise where you feel it due !

It costed £790. for an engineer to turn up for a day and 2 hrs the next day for the flushing, the heating went down again 8 days after the flush, I reset the boiler and it wasn't lit up. called the homecare services and the staff said they could send an engineer to have a look. The 2nd engineer had a look 3 days later during which we had been without central heating and hot water, been in the cold. the 2nd engineer released the air in the system in the roof and said it was an ignition failure in the boiler, he reset the boiler and said if they were to come out again, we'd be charged as we were not in the homecare service (was this the value for power flush £790 we were to be charged for). The heating worked for a day, it went down again this morning. We were in cold again and had to use 2 electronic radiators fully running for keeping warm, which wasn't enough for the whole house. This was what BG provided value for almost £800, a rocket price for something did't work at all. We should have the money back.

1,"            Absolutely impossible to deal with.I ended up having my FIT setup with british gas as at the time I wasn't told I had a choice.. but it wasn't *too* bad for the first couple of years except they insist on sending cheques and when queried about this stated British Gas have no facility to do bank transfers (the largest energy company in the country has no banking facilities.. pull the other one it's got bells on).Then something changed and it went completely off the rails.  A couple of readings I sent in were returned undelivered as the FIT department had apparently disappeared.  I persevered, and the submisison form was fixed and I started sending them it.  But was never paid.  They claimed they never got it, so I gave them the details directly by email.. which they lost.. That's when they respond.  You get an automated email promising contact 'within 3 days' the nothing.*Six months* after this happened I got a small cheque for a fraction of what was owed (but as they don't do bills it's impossible to query the amounts).  As it stands currently they owe me for the November reading and I'm due to put in for February.  I reckon they owe me about £300 by now but since they've gone complete radio silence I doubt I'll ever see it.Having had enough I decided to change FIT provider.  'It's easy' people said.  Well, nope.  I submitted my readings to the new provider, wrote BG an email telling them *exactly* why I was leaving.. and now I hear BG are stalling with the new provider as well and won't respond to them either... so I'm can't leave, won't get paid by BG.. great.

Sarcasm maybe.Then i called up the customer service line, i asked for an engineer to be sent and they did everything they could to avoid sending someone, even told me to mess with the main gas valve, to which i responded no chance im not skilled to do that.

Charged twice for a bill which left me over £1000 out of pocket. 7 days later, still not received my money back and no sign of a cheque despite informing them that my bank account had now been cleared out because of their error.  Have asked customer service agent 3 times when the cheque was sent to me and they can't give a straight answer.  Instead, they are quite explicitly telling me that I overpaid, I was not overcharged and that I could have claimed the money from my bank (which I had tried and was told I could not!). I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my life. Complete inability to take any responsibility or offer anything that resembles decent customer service.  After repeating my question about 6 times they finally admit that the cheque hasn't been posted yet (contradicting another agent last week who informed me it was on it's way which I proved through a transcript of the conversation). Absolutely disgraceful conduct.  This is just one of many incidents - last straw.  Now switching to another, smaller and more sustainable provider who actually have some morals and a conscience.

I have had need to call British Gas Homecare out on both properties recently, and in each case it took 3 x engineer visits to sort out the problem.   In the first case, the first 2 x engineer visits left the boiler in a dangerous state, leaking everywhere, and even flooding the kitchen in the flat underneath.   I had to call out local emergency services to attend the boiler as it was leaking everywhere.In the second instance (different property) there was no hot water to the shower.   I had previously called out a plumber who said the problem was most likely the boiler.   The first British Gas engineer disagreed and said it was a problem with the taps.   I called the plumber out again and he disagreed and insisted it was the boiler.   The second engineer visit did not turn up, and the 3rd appointment did fix the problem and indeed it was the boiler.I have absolutely no confidence in the British Gas Homecare Service, and would urge everyone to find an alternative if at all possible.

It ended up being 3 weeks apart causing confusion in the monthly payments.The app is difficult to use and consistently crashes when trying to access my details. Still not able to view payment history or anything to do with my account the app other than my account number.Decided to invest in Hive over the New Year...it was a big mistake. As I booked online, I was able to choose an installation time for an engineer to visit. No communication since and three weeks later on the day of the installation I get a call saying that it has to be rearranged (no reason given). Rearranged for the following week and in the meantime continued to call customer service to understand why, it turns out that their online booking system failed to book an engineer for the install and all I got as a way of compensation was £30 for missed installation.Recently, I looked into getting a smart meter for my utilities as I did with my last supplier, it turns out that I do not qualify as I already have a smart meter installed with a previous supplier. Again, no reason given, I do not understand why this would be or what sort of technical issue could result in them not being able to install. I understand if the meters are not compatible across suppliers, but no reason why they cannot simply replace existing with new so I can benefit from up to date meter readings and better usage tracking.

However, I had 2 small questions before I would accept the quote. One was for the Sales dept and the other was for Homecare. I'd like to note at this point that I have never had a problem with my Homecare cover in the 16+ years I've had it. They seem to be separate from BG and long may that continue.I first selected the phone option to 'Accept your quotation'. I sat listening to Coldplay for over 20 minutes and nobody picked up. I was trying to accept a quote for over £2500 and nobody could answer the phone?? I called again and tried a different option. To cut a very long story short, I spent 4 hours (yes FOUR) being passed around different people, calling other numbers their agents gave me (I collated 7 of them in total) and getting nowhere - un-bloody-believable.In the end I gave up and accepted the next best quote I had. How can they treat someone that way? You are sometimes unfortunate to get such service after a purchase but BEFORE?!? I was stunned.

I contacted BG online in November 2017 to make my appointment.  The earliest date being 07 February 2018!A BG Advisor contacted me at 3pm on 06 February, i.e. less than 24 hours before to cancel my booking as they were overloaded with customers with boiler breakdowns.  I stated that if they cancelled my booking, I would be cancelling my policy with them, as despite me paying my monthly premiums, they were in breach of their obligation to me to provide an annual service (now 3 months overdue) and less than 24 hours notice to cancel was unacceptable.  The BG Advisor said that she would make a note of my intention to cancel and hopefully the visit would go ahead.I was again contacted by a BG Advisor at 8pm that evening to cancel my booking.  I reiterated my earlier call with their colleague that afternoon that if they cancelled I would be too.  On my insistent request, I eventually spoke to a Manager, Stephen Barker who advised that they would try and honour my boiler service but could not guarantee this as they may still have to cancel on the day!On a positive note the boiler service appointment did go ahead as previously booked.  The engineer Lauren was on time and provided an excellent professional level of service.  Whilst the eventual outcome was an acceptable one, I do have to say that BG have gone down in my estimations regarding customer care as they clearly need to ensure that they have enough engineers to meet their customer demands and provide an adequate level of service.

Engineer came to fix boiler the next day but said it needed new parts. Came the next day to fit new parts and boiler was supposedly sorted.Boiler broke down again within hours so called for an emergency appointment and was told an engineer would be with us between 8-10am in the morning due to vulnerable people being in the property. Called at 10am to ask where engineer was and was told that no booking had been made and there was no record of a call. This isn't the first time this has happened and I am sick of receiving £30 cheques from this company what I actually want is for them to stop lying and fulfill their side of the bargain.Of course now I am in a queue to get an engineer visit before 6pm this evening..............I won't hold my breath, they always say that but they never turn up once you are in this circle of lies.I have informed them that if they do not attend before 1pm today that I will call a local gas safe engineer to get the fault corrected and use the Small Claims Court to get a refund from them.I actually used to recommend this policy but the last couple of years have been an absolute farce and it just gets worse.UPDATE:They actually did turn up and the boiler was fixed 24 hours later. No beef with the engineer but the call centre is a joke. Happy with the repair but a very, very stressful experience.

1,"            I was called by a rude arrogant Home care dispatcher yesterday.• he cancelled call out for break down after waiting at home for nearly 8 hours  with no heating or hot water and a failed attempt to fix this fault the day before.• lacked empathy after I explained I had made several calls throughout the day to understand ETA, to be faced with rude and argumentative behaviour.  After raising a complaint about this individual, the online webchat agent offered £30 goodwill payment and asked to close the complaint on the same day of it being raised ( this by the way does wonders to British gases day 1 complaint closures) imagine your regulators looking at all the complaints “resolved” in the first day, implying their great at satisfying customers who are dissatisfied ( just imagine a company being able to offer £30 just because I claimed someone had been rude, however they had yet to investigate the case) shows how much money BGAS are willing to throw about to shut customers up to improve complaint states!Now imagine a world of every customer making an official complaint and rather than accept a cheap pay off, ask those failing to offer a service to be held responsible for their actions and push for every complaint to go up the chain of their complaint handling process, this is what British want to avoid.My complaint is escalated, I’ve requested the transcript of this out bound call to myself to obtain an explanation from his superiors as to why they’ve allowed someone who clearly wasn’t destined to work in customer service, as he put it at the time “I don’t work in customer service, I’m a dispatcher who has the power to send an engineer”.. clearly he forgot he was calling a customer at the time of being so self righteous. TRUST PILOT IS GREAT TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE - however I urge everyone to raise formal complaints, this costs BGAS more than the £30 they’re happy to throw at anyone to shut them up, even worst complaints going to regularity level go cost into the £k’s

1,"            Terrible service and arrogance from British Gas. BG customer for many years (new boiler and system fitted a few years ago for approx £6,000), home heating and plumbing and electrical service contract for many years, receive gas and electricity supply from them but when it comes to a call out we receive false promises and lies and are met with arrogance. We are in our seventies, wife partially disabled, both not in good health, yet have had to endure the mis fortune of being BG customers. Recently had electrical and plumbing problems (leaks) and each time promised someone would be with us within 4 hrs only to have no one turn up until next day after numerous phone calls. Had no power or lighting or running water or central heating. They just do not Care! Do not even contact us to say the contractor would not be coming.BG need to sort out their customer service and franchised contractors because they are letting customers down badly. Our meters were read last month ( the electric meter is faulty and won’t show the two separate readings only one long flashing number. The meter reader has reported it but BG did not get back to us so we contacted them and they are going to fit smart meters, but not till the end of March. In the mean time our electricity direct debit has been reduced to £10 per month, I dread to think of our bill for electricity afterwards).We live in a rural area and it is a nightmare trying to find tradespersons to sort out heating and plumbing and electrical faults hence going with BG, now we are in despair over the way they operate but still take your money every month.We are now in the process of finding new suppliers and service contract, absolutely fuming at the shoddy treatment.

Called british gas to change the meters as it was hazard for my kid. they gave an appointment after 40 days!!!cancelled one appointment without informing me and when asked they compensated with a credit number which doesn't work.Their engineers will be available same day if it is a one off call service because this service is like cash cow to them. but safety is not concerned... utterly disappointed..!! avoid  if you can.

1,"            British Gas Home Care? I think they can dispense with the 'care' part of this title. We started with this scheme in November. They gave me a date of 6th Feb 18 (between 10 and 12pm) for a service of my gas boiler. At 10:20am (6th Feb 18) they called me to say they weren't going to come due to being 'inundated' with emergency calls! Really? What is it, they sudenly realised that they weren't going to make it a few minutes before calling me? I doubt it. I called their customer support....apology,apology. Not good enough BG. I was warned not to go with them because of their poor reputation but decided to give them a chance....well, they failed! I told them that an 87 year old widow nearby was also booked in for a boiler service before us and that they had not yet called her to cancel. Why? As it turns out at 11:40am they called her to say that they would be doing the service but would be late. She asked them if they were going to service my boiler and guess what? He replied 'It's not on my list'  Utter incompetence or dishonesty? You decide. I have already decided and have cancelled my contract with them. Should have listened to a friend and stayed well clear.

2,"            My elderly mother pays £43 a month for Home Care 4. So she paying £516 a year for an annual service, breakdown cover and household pipework and electrical. Our boiler is a warm air system, and was installed in 1986. The flue pipe in the loft was discovered to be corroded and it was then we found out Flue pipes longer than 'One Metre' are not covered. As she needed heating in the month of February, it was an urgent repair. British Gas charged us £336.00 for 3.5 hours work to repair the pipe. To say I am disgusted doesn't cover it. I will be looking for honest suitable cover in the very near future. This charge was a joke.

Tried contacting British Gas several times over the phone during Jan 2108 to find out where the final bill was. Didn't get through to anyone on 2 occasions. First week of Feb 2018 get a letter from a debt recovery agency relating to British Gas for an amount of £107. Eventually got through to British Gas to find out what was happening. They told me they had tried contacting me by email and had not received a reply. The email account was corrupted some 7 years ago so we obviously never saw it. They could not explain why they had not send a final bill through the mail nor why they hadn't phoned us. They also could not understand or explain why they had sent an email for the first time in 7 odd years! Just really, really poor from such a large company.

1,"            Since our boiler broke down in 2016 and we made the mistake in believing the sales rep that came to our house from british gas we have had nothing but issues. it took BG over 6 months !!!! to rectify an installation error (the thermostat on the boiler needed to be moved) so over the winter period we had very limited hot water and heating. We ended getting £££ back but that don't really make it right. They put in red bricks in our orange walls when fitting the hive and tried to explain to me i was colour blind that couldn't see it was the same colour. They charged us for a power wash of our radiators but never actually did one (at first) a week after the boiler was installed the boiler part of the cover fell off. when i called up i had the reply ""oh you again"" when the engineer came to fit it he told me it was a waste of time, it was just a cover and had no impact on the boiler. (not really the point though) this weekend we had yet again had issues with the boiler (the hive needed to be rebooted) when i talked to BG they told me that since i didnt have their homecare package they would charge me £225 for the reset if it was just this time or i could join their homecare package for £99 a month. I called up the hive people straight away and they reset it for free and apologized for my experience with BG

2,"            British Gas quoted an extortionate £785 to powerflush 6 radiators. I could replace all the radiators for much less (radiators £317 plus new fittings). Installing isn't a difficult job for a competent DIYer. I was going to take out a service contract but if I don't get the flush done they would have an excuse to do nothing if I call them out for a fault. I'll flush it myself or get someone else to do it cheaper. My 73 year old sister has her electrics insured by them. The engineer found a reason not to change the pull cord switch on her shower (it would not turn off - he said it was OK to leave it on). He refused because he said the fuse size on the circuit was too low (30 amps instead of 40). He also refused to change the fuse and would not even push it back in leaving her without a shower. It's not clear but he may have objected to the fuse box even though it looks fairly modern. I think they want her to pay for a new fuse box. A quote will arive and I suppose it will be massive. They inspect boilers etc. before taking on a service contract so if the fuse box is too old they should have said so before taking her money. I fear that they will refuse to do anything despite collecting the monthly fee. Due to this I will probably find another power supplier when my contract ends but I suppose they are all as bad.

1,"            Sent to CEODear Sir,I would appreciate your comments regarding the following.Mr. C. O’Connor, a 73 year old disabled gentleman moved into a one bedroom flat in April 2017, at which time opening meter readings were provided.  Following on from that, I myself contacted British Gas to ask for Mr. O’Connor to be placed on the list for extra assistance, including having his meter read.  To my knowledge the meter was read on three occasions, and we have tried to supply readings ourselves, however, the meter is a day/night system and quite difficult to understand if you are not shown how to read it.  Despite this, all the bills have been estimated.Mr. O’Connor has recently received a bill in excess of £500 for a three month period, hardly in line with his living situation.  I telephoned British Gas last week to query this bill, and the gentleman I spoke to stated that he would send an engineer out on the 1st February 2018 between 1-4 pm, however a meter reader arrived at 10am without prior notification, took readings and left, this caused distress to Mr. O’Connor.  I subsequently telephoned British Gas to try to determine what the bill would be following these readings.  I spoke to a gentleman, passed him the readings and was put on hold for a length of time, then transferred to another person.The person I was transferred to was extremely rude and unhelpful.  I tried to explain all of the above and was bluntly told that it is Mr. O’Connor’s fault because he has only ever given one meter reading, and this has generated this high bill.  I further tried to explain that he has been unable to read the meter and that British Gas should have sent someone out regularly to read the meter.   I was rudely told that legally they do not have to send someone out to read the meter, and she mentioned 3/5 years and quite loudly and abruptly stated that I shouldn’t ‘blame British Gas’.  Again I explained Mr. O’Connor is a 73 year old disabled person and it has been requested he was put down as requiring assistance.  All to no avail.  Despite having gone through security and giving my name as Mrs. Burgess, the rude, unhelpful lady continued to address me as Mrs. O’Connor and was not at all helpful in anyway, and then proceeded to terminate the call mid conversation.I am appalled that British Gas can treat a UK disabled pensioner in such a callous, unhelpful way and respectfully ask that you, as CEO, look into the history of the account and listen to the telephone calls, which I understand are recorded, and provide Mr. O’Connor an up-to-date, accurate bill from the opening readings to date.  Furthermore, I expect a full apology to both Mr. O’Connor and myself for such disgusting, unprofessional treatment.I have been in contact with a journalist, who is willing to write an article regarding this, should we not get a satisfactory outcome.I await your reply.Mrs. Jan Burgess

1,"            British Gas have engaged in some very questionable practices on accounts I manage. Firstly they, without authority took over one account form the existing supplier, no agreements were made no quotes given in fact no contact what so ever took place between the account holder and British Gas. This did not stop them informing the existing supplier that they had been requested to switch the account to themselves.They lied and must have provided false information in order to take the account.This is a matter that will go before OFGEMSecondly on an account I inherited with a vacant property. British Gas have loaded the account with a wild estimate (no gas use at all and refused a meter reading) and when it wasn't paid placed a red flag on my credit rating, to do this however they again created a false history showing payments up to date prior to the ""late payment"" when in fact no payment was ever made by me on this account. This company is totally untrustworthy they will deceive and scheme against both their competitors and more importantly against their customers. Do not fall for the ""British"" badge of honor in their title they have no honor and use that great name to disguise their truly despicable edifice.

1,"            I signed up to british gas' annual boiler service scheme on 4th December 2017. The first available date for a service was Tuesday 30th January 2018. This was not convenient for me due to work commitments and school run but I decided to make it work as it was so far away. The service was booked for between 2-4pm. The evening before the service I received an email from British Gas confirming the appointment but it was addressed to the previous owner of my home. I have lived there for over 5 years and have had both my gas and electricity supplied by British Gas for about the last 4 years. This is a minor point - but nevertheless tells me that the left hand does not know what the right is doing! So at 11.10am this morning (day of appointment) I receive a phone call from an 0800 number which I don't answer. They leave a voicemail asking me to call a different 0800 number and say they will ring back if I don't call. I call the number but the person of the end of the phone couldn't see any issues and confirmed the appointment would be going ahead as scheduled. I then receive a further call at 11.47am. I was using my office phone at the time so could not answer the call. This time the voicemail said that due to high demand for breakdowns they needed to reschedule my appointment. So I call them again. I express my unhappiness but agree to reschedule. The line goes dead. So I call them again, express my unhappiness again and begin to reschedule the appointment. The next available appointment was 27th March 2018 almost another 2 months. I actually asked the guy on the phone if he was joking! So i said that's ridiculous and said I wished to cancel my service contract. He immediately put me through to customer services where I received absolutely no fight from them, they just confirmed it was cancelled and the £79.30 that I had already paid on 20th December 2017 would be refunded to me within 3-5 days. I have stayed with British gas thinking I would be getting a great service now I will be reviewing my energy contract too!

2,"            Update: Boiler service cancelled without advising us in time. A letter sent in the post  on the Tuesday and our appointment was on Friday. This meant that we travelled all the way from Cornwall to Northamptonshire on the Thursday night and waited in all day on the Friday for our service. Having called them, they told us it was cancelled. Fortunately the person we spoke to on the phone was helpful and understood our situation and fitted us in the next day for service. Original review: Trying to book my annual service as the boiler was last serviced in December 16 and not able to due to emergencies taking priority. Managed to get a date which they are now trying to cancel due to a high number of repairs. Today is Monday, my appointment is Friday. Being told my contract started in November (we have renewed the same homecare package for several years), so the annual service could take place anytime in the 12 months of my contract. But its not annual if it doesn’t happen within 12 month? So the implication is that it is an annual renewal is not a continuous contract. In which case, I should have had my first service within 42days of taking out my new contract. So thats well overdue! T&Cs booklet they are asking me to refer to will come in handy.

Countless wrong bills, payments were problematic with them not putting my direct debit into effect in a timely manner and when contacted failed to rectify the matter resulting in me having to make several telephone calls at some cost to myself.Then an industry meter reading was submitted to them that was obviously wrong but that they failed to pick up which took 6 months to sort out.They then refunded money when I switched supplier only to inform me that there was money outstanding after 4 months, they then sent a E-mail given me fourteen days to pay before they would pass my details on to a debt collection agency who'll be in touch to collect the money.Steer clear!!

1,"            What is going wrong with British Gas? We have been loyal customers for years and assumed their Homecare Service plan (paying £275 a year) would give us peace of mind.  In past years they have reminded us about the annual boiler service and we have been able to make an appointment within days.  The boiler was last service by BG in August 2016. No reminder in 2017 so phoned in September to make an appointment and was surprised to be given a December date at the earliest. Two weeks before the appointment I received a phone call to say it would have to be postponed due to high demand for emergency repairs! Rearranged for 29 January. One week ago I received a text postponing again, same excuse and no alternative date given.  I tried to complain on their website complaint service and after spending a long time inputting my complaint I received a message saying ""whoops something has gone wrong"" when I tried to send the complaint. Looking on their on line booking system it seems that the earliest appointments are now in late March.  It will be over 18 months since the last service and we are supposed to be paying for an ANNUAL service!  I see that this is now common practice for British Gas.  Now seriously looking at alternative service arrangements and a new Gas and Electricity supplier.

1,"            British gas checked the dishwasher yesterday, it was broken again today and the next engineer is available in not less than 11 days and absolutely no Saturdays as BG does nearly no Saturdays. Why to waste time on British Gas Homecare when it would be cheaper to book an independent engineer or to buy a new dishwasher?Surely an homecare service that is not able to assist you in lest than 10 days and that cant assist on Saturdays when most people work during the week  should consider to stop the business as it is unable to deliver what is selling

1,"            I’ve been a British Gas customer since 1989 and have always been happy with service, until now! 3 days before my prebooked annual service I get a letter saying they need to cancel due to engineers being busy in emergencies. 3 days notice isn’t acceptable, I booked this appointment a long time ago as I had to get annual leave off work. I really dont think it’s the service engineers that will be covering emergencies. I think it’s just down to bad planning. Please get your act together and stop letting people down. This is a service we pay for and it isn’t acceptable. So disappointed in you.

I have been hospitalised for 2 months no one been in my home for this time nothing left on as my mum turned everything off and I have still used 150 pounds worth of gas in the last month??? I was in credit by £50 done a metre reading which took off £20 which left £30 to transfer back to me but apparently I don’t qualify for that now!! Not only have they took a rediculous amount of money from me for not being there they have now upped my gas and electric to £216 a month!!!!!!! Who pays that for a tiny 3 bed home!! British Gas are thrives. I’ve since done a go compare and have my gas and electric at £72 a month with a different supplier. Never again will I use British Gas how are they allowed to get away with this ???!!!!

On assurance of better service we renewed in 2016 but when a fully working boiler stopped working after the supposed service we had to complain again. October 2017 failure to locate a leak led to property damage four days off work and appallingly bad customer service from their complaints department. We are now processing a claim with the ombudsman which is something I have never felt the need to do before. Do not touch with a barge poll. Horrendous.

2,"            Signed up to British Gas and shortly after received an invoice for £450 for costs which we had not incurred. On ringing BG they said they did not see the invoice on their system and to ignore it. Weeks later, another invoice, and I phoned again. Again no records of the invoice and I was told to ignore it. This happened once more before I received another letter saying they would pass this debt over to a debt collection agency if I didn't pay. Another phone call and they still couldn't see the invoice on their system. On asking how this invoice could have come into existence they couldn't answer, eventually becoming frustrating with me, I hung up. Worried, I rang again using a number for a different department in BG. This time they found the invoice and confirmed it was a mistake and should be ignored - it would not be passed to a debt collection agency. I asked for a letter from them confirming there was no debt outstanding on my account and was told this would be sent to me - no letter was received. Lo and behold I then received a letter, texts, and phone calls from a debt collection company. I explained the situation to this company over the phone - the adviser put me on hold while she phoned BG, later telling me that BG had confirmed there was no invoice outstanding. Sensing my frustration the adviser said she would raise a complaint on my behalf. This was almost 2 weeks ago now, and no word from BG.All in all, with each call to BG taking around 1 hour, this has wasted about 5 hours of my time, and caused needless worry.

With a breakdown on my dishwasher I went to arrange an engineer to find that the dishwasher had been taken off my policy and replaced with a fridge which I don't have!  I telephoned on Monday and got passed around 6 people to be told that the dishwasher had never been insured with them.  It has actually been insured since 2007 and replaced in 2014 with a contribution from them, of which I have the paperwork.  I totally hold my hands up to not reading my renewal documents, but didn't really have the need to, I had made no changes, but British Gas certainly did!  It was removed because the new appliance had a manufacturers guarantee on, which I totally understand, but at no point did they advise me they had taken it off, or indeed to send a reminder to put back on!  The customer service is shocking, when I asked to cancel my policy, I actually got offered a cheaper premium to make me happy with a £60.00 excess, why would I do that?  The premium I pay is not the issue, its the drama you have to go though anytime you need to speak to them.

1,"            DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT DATE!All I wanted to do was change the date my direct debit comes out of my bank!  The incompetent staff at British Gas decided that they would cancel it instead and because for some reason that they’ve yet to explain they failed to collect Decembers direct debit, they can’t just reinstate my £47 DD with the date changed until I’ve made a payment.  And now I’ve made the payment they want to reinstate my direct debit at £121 a month!  Surely as this is all entirely of their own making they should simply put me back in to the position I should have been in has they followed my instructions?!?Even if we forget about the fact that they’ve screwed up my direct debit how come such a big change in the monthly amount?  British Gas have a huge number of customers and have been providing energy for a VERY long time.  With that much data at their disposal, how are they still so inexplicably bad at estimating energy usage?  Based on £121 a month, they are estimating my husband and I will use £1400+ of energy over the course of this year.  Last year we used £970, the previous year £1030.  Where do they get their numbers, they certainly aren’t basing it on my usage.And now of course I don’t trust them to manage my direct debit so want to cancel it and set up a standing order for a fixed amount that I can manage each month without having to contact them (because based on this experience contacting them is pointless) but British Gas don’t recognise bank transfer or standing order as a payment method!  Are we not living in an age where I can use my phone to pay for goods or services, in fact if I’m so inclined I could use a watch!  I can pay HMRC by transfer, DVLA even accept them but not good old British Gas!!!  Is it not time this dinosaur of a company offered its customers more choice and flexibility.And my compensation for this fiasco they have created and the hours I’ve wasted trying to get it sorted?! A £5 credit to my account.  I hope their staff feel utterly ashamed when that’s all they can offer to customers that they’ve screwed up with.So my advise if you want to change the date your direct debit goes out and dont want to waste hours of your life having to deal with these incompetent idiots, don’t bother changing the date, or do what i’m About to and move to another supplier.

Money had to be paid in advance. The appointment, made for early Dec., was put back until January. The engineer did not arrive at the agreed time and we had to wait in all day in a cold house as we were told that the boiler would have to be cool for servicing.   When he arrived a minor fault was found in the condensing pipe. He declared the boiler unsafe.  We were left with no central heating over the weekend. After again contacting the company on Monday at 3pm. we were told that he had ordered the wrong part, that we would have a visit from another engineer so that the correct part could be ordered. They gave us no idea as to when the part would be fitted and there was total indifference to our distress.We contacted BRITISH GAS in desperation, as we had no heating and the house was freezing. Their attitude was in complete contrast. They did not ask for payment up front.   An engineer arrived within 1/2 an hour, serviced the boiler, said that a temporary repair could have been made to cover the weekend. He contacted a colleague and the replacement part was fitted that evening. That, in my book, is an excellent service from a reputable company.A valuable lesson well learnt. Our grateful thanks to British Gas, to the caring and competent engineer and to his colleague who delivered the part.

Service was due last September but the earliest appointment I could get back then was for 18th January.   Today that appointment was cancelled (by letter) and although I have spoken to Customer Services the next appointment is 13th March which will be over 6 months since due date.   I am paying for this service in the expensive monthly charges and find it totally unacceptable and who's to say the next appointment won't be cancelled as I have no confidence in BG any more.   Homecare contract is expensive when you are not getting full value with an annual boiler service.    If you don't need Homecare I just wouldn't bother, especially if you have a reasonably new boiler as you are getting poor value for money and very poor customer service;   it took a supervisor to offer an apology of some sort but even when I took it to the next level I couldn't get a service before middle of March.    Shame on you BG,  you must have cut down on staff to such a degree that you can no longer offer even a basic service.      Once the contract ends I will consider taking my business elsewhere.

The complaints team were rude and unhelpful throughout.Appointment was re-booked for Monday morning, again nobody showed up. They called later to say the engineer was busy and they would come between 6-8pm. Again nobody showed up. They called to try to re-book, we suggested some times and they said they would ring us back. They didn't. Have now booked an appointment for a week's time. Absolutely appalling service.

Been a loyal customer for years, stuck with British Gas when I moved properties assuming there would be benefits to remaining loyal. None. If anything it is worse. After threatening calls and letters relating to an unpaid bill, was told I could not decide to go with another supplier at my new address exactly because I was already a current customer. Do not give these people a penny if you can avoid it.

They took back my supply without my consent and told me on a recorded line that I had verbally entered in to a legal binding contract to take back my supply, which was a lie.

They sorted it out and said that all my balances were zero. But I probably wouldn't be writing this if it was that simple. A few weeks later I receive another letter from british gas telling me to pay what I owe...So I contact them again and they confirm that my balances are zero and I should ignore this letter.A month later I receive a letter from Debt collectors still demanding what I owe (which is zero)  I contact British gas yet once again and after being transferred 3 times I finally got to the right department and told them that I can send them a chat transcript which explained everything. For some reason I was given a general inquiry email. I mean how is my issue a general inquiry?! So I'm sending this email thinking the person who'll end up reading it will have no clue whatsoever so I explain everything one more time (4th).And guess what?! After I sent the email, it was not delivered because my email was blacklisted...I mean.. what now???! I haven't heard back from them yet.To be continued...

1,"            The worse experience with the British Gas Company todayThey sent the adviser for installation of a new boiler and we agreed for a fixed guaranteed quotation to install a new boiler and replace the old one. The advisor given us fixed price quotation, if any extra work done it will not cost us extra and that she is our dedicated adviser to facilitate the process throughout. She also gave the time for installation after one and a half month. I signed off the contract same day after getting a repayment plan authorized of the bank. Till that stage we were happy with the service and the saying on the paper work and also verball from the adviser that "" The price we quote is the price you'll pay ....Guaranteed We'll carry out the work for this price and that's a promise""When on the given date the installation team arrived I was at work, they were asking me for the plan of work over the phone as if the installation team doesn't know what they are going to do ( obvious communication gap between the adviser and the installation team. Then in the second call they told us that we would need to pay extra for the removal of the old system from the old place as it would demolish the wall etc. and that we should get it sorted in summer time because that will take time !!!! A service highly unprofessional and against their promises of fixed price guaranteed no matter what. Also as lay person we trust that the quotation you are giving us is after assessing carefully the work you need to do and that you will tell us about all the potential problems which you are not sure or can't foresee initially. But then also you should not finalize the deal if you are not sure about the quantity and type of work. We believe that a reputable company like the British Gas is sending us a responsible advisers who must know their job but after a poor experience I think we were wrong.When tried to contact that adviser for 2 days and that she did not pick up the call.When contacted the company they also didn't satisfied us. The manager I contacted the second day myself even told me over the phone that he apologies but lets move on and if you agree for extra work which needs to be done and paid by us  then they would proceed further with a new date He also mentioned that we are very busy and that you decide what you want us to do next, very disappointing that the company like this have no business ethics to deal with an unhappy customer who trusted on them because of their name and reputation Leaving me without any options and without any explanation of their faults in the process, I finally decided to cancel my job with them as a very unhappy customer In summary in my view the problem with them are:Poor communication between their advisers and their installation team Poor communication with the client To take up business they do false promises ( in writing)They are not competitive and still take unnecessary long time for their work Their team don't identify extra work and don't timely update their new clients for the potential problems just before getting business Sorry but with this type of service it's waste of our precious time and lot of mental stress and my advice to many others would be not to choose them at all

1,"            Picture this: You have a service/repair contract with British gas for your combi boiler and radiators. A small leak develops at a radiator trv valve. You call British gas. They send out a third party plumber who instead of unscrewing the radiator cover from the wall rips it from the wall destroying the fixings and cover itself. He then proceeds to install a new valve incorrectly and by morning the kitchen ceiling is soaking wet with sodden plasterboard dripping onto the floor below. You take more time of work to wait for a second technician to repair the work of the first idiot. You spend the next few days drying out your ceiling, repairing the plasterboard then apply several coats of primer and paint. And just like that your combi boiler stops working. They send out another technician who thinks it might be the circuit board "" We canny get the parts for they old boilers""  says he ""How convenient for you"" i say. ""Then why do you take money up front year after year for your service contact knowing full well you can't make the repairs when needed?""  I ask..... Silence....He then suggests he might have to CONDEMN the boiler (gas talk for making it not work permanently) however I pointed out that almost every spare part for the boiler was available online. He said he could only use parts from his authorized supplier. Imagine that folks they can only use a supplier who makes a point of not stocking the parts you actually need even when they are easily available elsewhere. Then come the discrete hints about them selling you a new boiler and installation service. Once he realized we were not biting he amazingly fixed the boiler with no parts and we quickly cancelled the service contract. The boiler has be working well ever since. It was clear to me these guys have been well trained in the art of upsell, fear and bulls**t.  I could have easily made the repairs myself for around a tenner, It would have taken me less than an hour but It took me around twenty hours to repair my kitchen ceiling and several hours of lost work waiting for these guys. Disgusting Scammers make me sick.

Had I not got in touch, they would never have told me that the gas transfer had failed to transfer. Meanwhile I have been on a punitive standard tariff with Scottish Power since December 2017, as I expected both gas and electricity to transfer as part of the dual fuel transfer.I just wonder what would have happened if I hadn't phoned British Gas to check why my gas supply had not transferred but my electricity had transferred in November 2017?

We had  British Gas Homecare so called them up and told them that the boiler wasn't working and the my girlfriend who has had heart surgery needs the heating to be on during this cold period. They sent an emergency engineer over that eventually turned up at 1am. he looked at the boiler and said that he had borrowed a van and didn't really have any tools. He then carried on texting on his phone and that was it. The next day (Saturday) another engineer arrived and spent the whole day fixing!?!?! the boiler. lovely guy but the next day the boiler was on the blink again. Called BG and they made another appointment for the following day. They didn't turn up or even call us. I called them and they said we have to reschedule, no sorry or anything. I told them I had someone sick at home so they said they would send an emergency guy over. By 11pm no one had turned up so I called and they told me that there were still three jobs ahead of me and that they would not fix anything only make the boiler safe. Needless to say no one came. I now have another appointment in two days time so let's see what happens.I would not recommend BG to anyone, most of the guys they have working for them have such a heavy workload that they don't have the time to actually fix boilers and most of the time do not have the tools or the parts.Total waste of time and money!!!

This is a horrendous way of treating their clients and tenants, as it's currently 5 degrees.

I phoned Whirlpool and was told that after I arranged the appointment with British Gas they had only contacted them 12! days after my call to arrange for them to come. By then there was no appointment left. Despite knowing that, British Gas confirmed my appointment by text the day before.

1,"            British Gas is totally incompetent I cant imagine how they stay in business.  I thought Scottish Power was appalling so switched back to British Gas on April 1st 2018 and they still have not managed to tell me what my bill is so far 9 months later.    We were with them two years ago before changing to Scottish power for various reasons one of which was that they were unable to register me with an on line account. So I had no on line means of checking where I was with our bill. After I had been back with them for about 3 months and after considerable chasing they eventually succeeded in providing me with an online account which showed that they had held onto £2,200 of our money when we left them and had not told us about it.  So I immediately asked that they return it to us but they said they could not do that as we owed them for our current supply.  I said that was monstrous because we were unable to pay because they were unable to tell us what we owed them and after some weeks of hassling them they did pay it back.  But we are now on January 4th 2018 and they still cannot tell us what we owe them since April 1st.  We had a smart metre installed when we were with them originally and they say they cant read it.  At one point they sent me a bill for about £20,000, which after some research and chasing by me, they discovered was so high because they had taken the start date from the reading when we left them previously rather than when we joined them in 2017.  Also I tried to persuade them to accept the reading we had given them on 19th March 2017 when we thought we were moving on March 20th, which was made impossible by Scottish Power but they said it would not be accurate enough.  I am sure some of the problems why the big providers are so entirely inefficient must be because of the system but it must be very depressing to either run, or work in, companies that are so inefficient.

So I requested a reduction is this and they recommended I should pay £79 per month.  If that is so, why didn't they adjust it automatically?To avoid getting ripped off, when you get your bill, go to payments then 'manage my direct debit' and refund the credit.  Then do the same for the monthly payment.  And enjoy having possibly 100's of £'s of extra cash next month to pay off the Xmas bills!

In between having a quick look at our 'old' boiler and trying to inform us of the benefits of a new one, so far so good, or so we thought. Then to our horror, he informed us that we were losing pressure at the rate of 21mb per minute. But he would do all he could to find the fault. He changed the gas meter and installed the smart meter but we were still losing 21mb per minute. We were by this time stressed to say the least. The engineer told us not to use any gas appliance. Given this, our new years meal with the family at our house was by this stage in tatters.  He then informed us that the boiler was at fault and 'disked' our meter as a safety procaution leaving us with no heating or hot water. We had to sign a letter stating there was immediate danger to our property and I quote, 'it is an offence to use a gas appliance or installation knowing it to be at risk'. He then left saying he was sorry but there was nothing else he could do unless we had a BG service plan, which clearly is another sales ploy. My own plumber, who we trust immensly, was on holiday and couldn't get to us until today, the 2nd January. Today our own Corgi registered plumber informed us there was nothing wrong with our system nor the boiler. The British Gas 'engineer', he used the term loosely, had failed to isolate the boiler properly and thus it was still drawing pressure. It took my plumber 20 minutes and £20 to sort this out with no spare parts needed. BG need to get their act together. The service we recieved is digusting. Why are Smart Energy Experts, again I use the term loosely, allowed to attempt this level of diagnosis? They are not gas engineers nor are they experts in any sense.

Very professional lady named Jamila replied to my complaint (within 24hrs) that I'd logged onto the British Gas website.She promptly acknowledged my complaint and gave me step by step details of how she was going to resolve my issue.She resolved it alot quicker then I had anticipated and she kept me informed throughtout the process.The money was a bonus as it cleared my outstanding gas and electricity arrears..British gas have always provided exceptional customer service.Jamila was definitely a very professional individual who resolved my issue with great empathy and dedication.. thank you once again

They will take your money & they will offer excuses. They will call to tell you they can’t fix your problem with no heat or hot water because you aren’t a priority but you pay the same.

1,"            I used there Landlord facility to service and repair a tenants boiler. It was a straight forward job but as the boiler was about 7-8 years old i though it would be a good idea should it start becoming troublesome. They came out and replaced a few parts, the engineer also called on other engineers to come round and have a look. The end result was i should pay £800 for a flush and vibro clean of the heat exchanger. Even though the water in the heating system is crystal clear with no sludge or bits present.Long story short the push rod in the diverter valve wasn't returning to closed position, something which if you read the manual could have been eliminated. It took a proper engineer 2 hours to fix.Even though they cancelled the my policy twice, we still had to chase them up for the refund. We also made numerous calls and lost two days waiting in for the engineer that I will never get back.Overall the whole experience is far short of the service we were expecting. Unfortunately for them they have now missed out on several other properties which were going to cover.

1,"            The only reason we were with British gas was because our new property was defaulted to being with them, otherwise the other correctly scathing reviews would have turned us away.I seem to have to talk to these idiots at least once a month because their joke of a system is wrong or I have to enquire as to why my account has been changed without me asking for itI put in my meter reading, I was told a price for my Gas bill, promptly paid it and was then told I suddenly owe another £20 from nowhere! I then had a chat conversation with one of their employees that felt like a lifetime of him telling me how the prices are calculated, instead of explaining to me how I suddenly owed another 20 pounds worth of extra gas between me taking a meter reading, entering my details and paying. This is just one of many different issues I have had with them, I cannot put into words how much this company does not care about any of their customers.

Both appointments were on cold days......If they had phoned first thing  at least I could have re -scheduled the appointment! really terrible communication and service from British Gas !!

1,"            All I can say is that don't expect good service with what is laughingly called a service contract. Been a customer for donkeys years (10+) pay an extortionate £45 a month for boiler and cooker cover (tried to get the husband to switch - he wasn't having it - then). Sadly, one of our oven conked out before the holiday (A Rangemaster - may be the subject of another review). We have another one oven on the cooker so inconvenient, but not tragic (that buzzes since it was repaired by British Gas a few years ago) and it was meant to be fixed today - apparently they called, and cancelled the appointment (why home number wasn't tried I simply do not know) and moved it to the fourth January. So, almost £600 a year for a service that means it might be fixed next week (two weeks after the initial call) assuming that they don't arrive and say ""I need ""x"" part - will be back in a week or two. I believe local repairers could get this done. The company in Walsall that services the cooker says they have the parts and a service person can be out Friday - £250 - a hell of a lot less than the contract we are paying for. Lots of apologies from the poor lady on the phone, but still paying for a service not received. Looking at other reviews that say they are being left without heat that is worse for sure - but at the end of the day, it is a service contract - all the lovely adverts about same day service just don't seem to apply in the real world. I hope now the hubby will be willing to switch to a contract that is less than half the cost - it may still be lousy service, but at least it would save a few hundred quid! He would be crowing about the service had it been had, but no doing. He has filed a complaint - the person was cagey about responsiveness, and based on reviews here, it will be to no avail. I will either buy a new cooker and have this tomorrow, and end this silly contract, or will get a new contract anyway, and finally get rid of this expensive no service contract. You have been warned!

1,"            I really need to warn people about the horrendous time I've had with British Gas over the last 3 months. I moved in to a new house which had a BG supply & tried to switch to 3 separate suppliers without success. BG Customer Services gave me every excuse as to why I couldn't change suppliers from your smart meter with us isn't compatible with the other supplier to the other company is lying about you being on two tariffs at once with us it you're on an economy 7 meter, oh that's not right you're a business user, this went on and on and I know more about tariffs than they do now due to this!!In all, I had 6 separate issues which took 3 months to resolve & this only got done when I emailed the CEO. Nobody took ownership of the situation until then. The issue finally got resolved last week & they promised to refund me £75 & said to do this, I'd need to keep my direct debit open. On the 20th of December I successfully switched to another supplier but on the 18th of December British Gas took £65 out of my account. They say I will get this money back once they've calculated how much I have used in fuel but how dare they take this amount for two days worth of fuel after the costs & time I've incurred due to their incompetence and constant errors which they continuously tried to cover up & pass the blame to energy suppliers who hadn't even provided a service yet. This is the worst case of poor service I've ever experienced & I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who hasn't had the patience to fight this to get a resolution. Lastly, I have been leaving messages for the last person I dealt with to call me back & she has not & was conveniently on the phone when I called for her. I've also emailed her & got no response from so they obviously have no interest in helping me & are fully aware that they have messed up once again!Please do not make the same mistake I did.

1,"            So disappointed with British Gas.  7 appointments with British Gas in December.  2 they cancelled by phone, another they just cancelled on the website with no indication that it would be cancelled.  It was due for 24th December, they just moved it to 3rd January.  If I did not log in to check I would not even have known.  A few days ago an engineer replaced my pump.  He installed a pump that is incompatible with my boiler.  I only have heating for a few minutes at a time as the thermostat shoots into the red after 5 minutes.  When I called BG I was told there was nothing they could do, I have to wait until January, if I was cold then I must drink a hot drink this was before the agent just hung up on me.  It goes on and on.  I have even called the chairman’s office to complain.  Full of apologies but no repair so far in sight.  I would give negative stars if I could.  I have been polite, I have been accommodating, and I have been messed around. Yes I have had call backs, but a call back is not going to keep me warm.  And why call me back when afterwards my next appointment is just cancelled.

1,"            Paid £216 for annual boiler/central heating cover at the start of the year. BG arranged for annual service to be carried out in October. The engineer apparently serviced the appliance, only problem, the boiler now keeps shutting down every 10 minutes! BG cannot arrange for an engineer to visit on the same day, even though there is an elderly pensioner and 2 babies in the property. The next day I am told the boiler has a dangerous leak and needs to be shut down. 'Possible' causes are hypothesised and parts are ordered. Told I will be without heating/hot water for another day and the engineer will return first thing next day with the parts. Next day arrives, no sign of any engineer. Call BG in the afternoon to be told that the engineer has called in sick (only, he forgot to mention that he has shut down someones boiler - no biggie!). After an argument on the phone BG eventually agree to send someone else. They try the ordered parts - problem persists, after much head scratching and a visit from Transco (actual professionals who know what they are doing) further parts are ordered and finally the boiler is repaired. Logged a complaint with BG as I had a fully functioning boiler until it was serviced and left leaking. Took 9 weeks for them offer £50 compensation for two failed visits and deny any accountability for the leak and fault. I have also managed to obtain a log of the readings taken during the visits, absolutely disgusted to discover the boiler was left leaking carbon monoxide at 4x the legal limit. The amount leaking can result in death within 2-3 hours of exposure, luckily the boiler is installed in the garage where there is no need to be there for long periods of time. Suffice to say, I am taking this matter further. Cherry on top is that the complaint has taken 9 weeks to process within this period I have received my automatic renewal notice where the premium has gone up by £50!. Avoid these cowboys like the plague. Much more reputable insurers out there.

At 11, I was contact and told that the engineer was delayed and would attend in the afternoon between 1 and 6.  At 5 pm, i was contacted and told engineer would attend between 6 and 8.   On each episode, when it became increasing apparent that no one was about to appear, I contacted the call centre who reassured me that i was scheduled for a visit.  My distress to waiting in a house for 12 hours with no heating and freezing conditions outside, was met with laughter and the statement that the engineers were very busy.  The engineer eventually turned up at midnight.  Although temporarily fixed, another engineer was required 5 days later.  The number of engineers is obviously far to low to meet demand, especially when there is a cold spell. The service is expensive and poor value, with no ability to communicate with relevant people.  Even the complaints procedure takes approx. 8 weeks.

I spent few hours trying to reach them on Saturday when the boiler stopped working, but the automatic call suggested to schedule a visit online. So went to their website and the next available date was on Wednesday, which I booked for between 08:00AM and 01:00PM. I also received an email from them with a confirmation of my booking for Wednesday. So after spending four days in cold and with cold water, on Wednesday I opted to stay home so that I can get our boiler fixed. I called them around 10:20AM to check who was coming and when, and I came to know that engineer was not assigned yet for which I complained. I got a call around 11:30AM saying that the engineer might not come by 01:00PM as they are having a very high volume of calls, but someone would come late in the afternoon, to which I said okay.They called again around 03:00PM and said the engineer cannot come today so they would like to re-schedule the appointment. So I have been paying them in advance for a service, for which they made me and my family (including little children) wait for four days in the cold weather and with cold water.  And then they also cancelled an already booked appointment. Very unfair, unprofessional, unethical !

It appeared to me the issue  was in some way to do with the fan. The  only engineer who  was prepared to listen  was GARY ESSEX. In fact he was the only one who removed the fan and guess what, all the soldered connections on the electrical input had failed. Had a new fan and issues appear to have been resolved.

1,"            Claire Miles,It is both diabolical and inconceivable to be paying the best part of £40 per month for insurance that has been rendered effectively useless during the time of year when it is needed most!!  I cannot imagine any company that would leave a pensioner without heating and hot water during the winter for 2 weeks!  Recent boiler repairs have been shoddy, to say the least, due to (and I speculate) a blatant focus on trying to fleece customers into buying a new boiler.  The boiler should not have broken down again so soon after such a short period of time, since the last repair.  If you don't have the engineers available to do the job required then you shouldn't be selling insurance.  My mother will be seeking a full refund of this month's homecare premium and will consider all other options available.  The engineer had better turn up on the new date advised or there will be hell to pay.  If you have to source out of area then so be it.  But this is truly inhumane and unacceptable.

1,"            Since they haven't replied to my email that I sent 3 weeks ago, thought I would share...I just want to express my absolute disgust at the way I have been treated from British Gas. I signed up to your home care plan last year in December and had no issues at all until a month or so ago. For the past 6 weeks I have had bother with my boiler and had to use the service. The time slots are not accommodating for those with a working lifestyle, 6 hours is an absolute shocking time to expect people to wait about for. Since this saga started I have lost out on 5 days of work, which I do not get paid for and considering I run a house by myself that is a huge inconvenience to me especially at this time of year. I had 3 engineers out within the space of a week or so to fix the boiler, each claiming there was something different wrong with it. Once the 3rd engineer claimed to have fixed my boiler I had already pretty much decided to cancel my homecare plan after my experience, then I received a letter saying the price would be increasing by £4 each month when my contract renews in December. After the shambles I had went through this absolutely confirmed I was going to cancel. One of your team then phoned me, I explained why I was cancelling and that I was planning on going to a competitor who is cheaper and offer a better service i.e coming out 24 hours etc and the woman on the phone could not have cared less and did not try AT ALL to keep my custom. A week later the boiler broke again, so yet again at 8pm on Monday night I was left with no hot water or heating in the height of winter. I decided to call your emergency line and explained the situation. I appreciate your emergency line is for gas leaks etc but not once did I say that that was my problem. Even when the man on the phone asked if it was my gas pressure dropping or my water pressure I confirmed water and said there was nothing wrong with the gas, I have witnesses for this. Yet one of your team proceeded to lead me to believe that an “engineer” would be out within 2 hours. What in fact happened was a SGN engineer turned up because he said that he was told I had a gas leak, an absolute lie from a member of your team. He said he gets it al the time from British Gas and whoever I had spoken to would have just wanted me off the phone and just passing the blame onto another company. He told me to 100% make sure I get compensation from you because of the absolute farce your company made me and him go through on a Monday night! The following day I had to wait from 12-6 (day 4 off work) for an engineer to come  out, he had to order a part and come back in the morning today (day 5 off work) and it is now apparently fixed.

1,"            I have to agree with the comments further down. I have been a British Gas customer for over twenty years and when I called them out fior no hearing or hot water the earliest appointment they could offer was 5 days away! On the annual service they’re very keen to sell you new products, such as Hive, but when they can’t get the basics right and provide the service you’ve already paid for why would you buy anything else from them? I suspect I won’t be renewing cover with them when it’s due - perhaps if enough customers leave those that are left will get a proper response cover. BTW British Gas “severe weather” happens most years, it’s called WINTER.

1,"            If you are thinking of getting a Homecare agreement be aware of the following features:(1) They will never ever turn up for an appointment. You will take the day off and at 6pm they will call to tell you they are too busy. The next appointment will be in 5 days (which they will also cancel). Sometimes they will claim that they called but you were not in even though you were sitting by the door all day. They will claim that knowing the colour of the door proves they were there.Also be aware that they won’t talk to you when they cancel (that would be too embarassing). They will put the phone on mute when you answer and wait until it goes to voicemail.(2) They will do everything possible to claim it is your fault and that you have to pay for any work done on top of what you are already paying for the contract.(3) They will attempt to increase your premium by around £100 every year.Rogue traders doesn’t begin to describe how incompetent this company is. Save your money and call a local plumber if something goes wrong.

Eventually they agreed on one cause and when I asked them to repair it they said they were to busy at this time of the year and wouldn’t be able to repair it until March or April 2018, I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

I explained as the radiator was leaking from the pipe entering the bottom of the valve I Could not catch the leaking water by placing anything under it, they suggested a technical method of placing a towel around the leak.

I have never had to call them out until recently. I had to wait 5 days for an appointment which was meant to be today. When the Engineer didn’t turn up I chased them and was told they couldn’t trace the engineers location . I made a fuss about this and finally they agreed to call their dispatch center to see where he was. It turns out they had cancelled my appointment! Without even bothering to tell me! I now have to wait a further 5 days for an appointment. Seriously?? Apparently they are too busy. As far as I am concerned I paid for a service and I didn’t get what I paid for. It is up to BG to employ enough people to deal with emergencies. That’s why I pay them! They have essentially shown me two fingers and told me to take it or leave it. I cannot tell you how disgusted I am by their pathetic level of service and careless attitude. I should never have signed up with them. I could have then saved several hundred pounds and could have used some of that to pay an independent engineer  to come out. If you are considering Homecare seriously don’t bother. Save your money. I feel as if I have literally poured hundreds of pounds down the drain. Bye bye from me BG if this is how you treat loyal customers, you won’t be cheating me out of my hard earned cash anymore.

I paid to have it fixed and yet they've left me with a boiler that's obviously not fixed. I'm appalled by British Gas for being so underhand. I have a disabled daughter who needs the heating to work.

Needless to say this experience caused my anxiety to go off the scales.Still I think vulnerability is irrelevant as they're taking away our human basic right to hot water and heating.When I called back to complain I was ignored and not heard and kept being told to buy heaters from Argos.When I asked for a refund on my homecare, I was told no.When I asked to place a formal complain, I was ignored.British gas treat loyal customers appallingly!!!

They cost £99 plus £23 per month and has already paid for itself, the engineer has been out twice already and will be returning tomorrow to check on my grandmother and make sure everything is working OK. Considering it was late evening when I called them they have been more than efficient and were quite concerned about my grandmothers wellbeing, ensuring we kept her supplied with hot water bottles, blankets and hot drinks until the engineer arrived, which was within 3 hours. She is more than happy with the service received and glad we got her the cover. Well done British Gas!!

In the 6 years they have only ever kept one appointment. They constantly cancel, even when I have a boiler breakdown with no heating or hot water. The then tell me I am not a priority, even though I pay the same amount of money every year as anyone else. Even the annual service gets constantly cancelled and thats in August. The final straw came today when I waited in all day for the engineers visit only to be told it had again been cancelled. Do not get homeware cover.

Trying to get through on the phone took 37 minutes to be told that we had been re scheduled to next Wednesday as we are not classed as an emergency.  It is now Saturday and no one had the decency to let us know. I know the weather is bad but surely they look at the forecast and arrange the workforce accordingly.

The experience will leave you exhausted, exasperated and wondering how they are allowed by the Regulator to have such shoddy business practices.If you don't have one of their policies but are thinking about taking one then read the reviews here very carefully before making your mind up.Their T&C's are deliberately vague and opaque for defining when an ""engineer"" (in reality a technician) will be available in the event you have an issue that you thought would elicit a rapid response.No heating or hot water in the middle of winter when it's below zero degrees and snowing? That means a minimum 48 hour wait, a mandatory £50 excess and a time slot of between midday to 6pm but that may change if they see fit if they have higher priority callouts. And that's to fix a problem they were supposed to have previously corrected for which we'd already paid. They do not have enough technicians and winter seems to have caught them by surprise.There are much cheaper options available than British Gas and I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere.

They took more than a month to respond and in the mean time they cancelled my direct debit without instructions. Sent an engineer to my house in my absence without my permission and did some work in smart meters when my husband at home.and he was unaware of the whole issue. And the whole dispute went for few months and in the mean time , never resolved. I told them I will switch the supplier and pay the bill. Before they  sent the bill I had to go out of country for an emergency.  I told them I will come and pay the bill in full and they said it us fine. I spoke to customer service at least 50 times for this issue. Multiple times they said I can pay the bill once it is resolved. They agreed they cancelled direct debit by mistake in an email. But now they say it was my request. I have an email. I came back from holiday and paid the full bill. Still they reported to credit agency 2 late payments on my account which is affecting my mortgage now. I tried to speak to them, 2 agents said it was not my mistake and they will get it removed in 10 days and I will get a call from British gas. No call till now and I called them this agent is so rude and she says I know BG cancelled DD but why didn't u check your account that money is not going you should have paid it. She is not trying to listen to me instead is blaming me for not paying the bill. Was trying g to explain her paying is not a problem but wanted an answer from BG. BG agents told me I can pay after coming back as the final bill was not settled.  They never advised me it will reflect as late payment. As there was an issue here I thought i can pay once the bill is settled. But this lady today is so rude and unacceptable. Now BG information has affected my credit rating. Today I decide not to be BG customer for life and advise my family on the same.  I don't mind paying even higher cost to other suppliers bit never BG in life. I was asking the lady how can BG decide things without consulting me about cancelling DD, sending engineer without pernission, writing on my acvount that i requested DD cancellation - she says they can do that as they are in that position.

I had Home Care cover before the installation and that was discounted in the first year.  They then quoted me a price for the second year which took into account I had a 5 year warranty on the boiler.  When I rang to book the annual service I was told it would cost me £79.99 only then did I discovered that they had quoted me a price which did not include the central heating system which I was paying to be covered for before I had the installation.  When I complained I was informed I had been given three options on the renewal date, which I had not.  Anyway I paid for the upgrade which included the annual service and booked one for a morning between 08.00 and 13.00.  So I made sure I was home that day and cleared access to the boiler only to receive a letter around 10.00 on the day of the appointment saying it had been cancelled.  The best appointment they can offer me now is eight weeks time.  For my warranty on the boiler to be valid I need the boiler serviced every year but it seems British Gas are incapable of servicing my boiler once a year.  I feel completely betrayed by British Gas who sold me a new boiler specifying terms they are unable to meet.  I have stuck with British Gas all these years as I did not want to risk me paying a cowboy outfit to supply my gas and electricity, after over two hours on the phone with them I have discovered that British Gas is a cowboy outfit.

Called back a few minutes later to leave an alternative contact number for the engineer and was told no record of my call! Agent said they have no idea why I was told 15-30 minutes as they do not have access to engineers. Booked again and was told an engineer would arrive by 1pm. Called at 1pm, was told engineer held up on other job and would be with us asap. Engineer eventually arrived at 3pm and within 5 minutes diagnosed the problem as the electricity meter and then said “I’m not a meter engineer, you’ll need to get another engineer out”! He even had the cheek to say “YOU’VE (i.e. Me) booked the wrong engineer”!!! Another engineer arrived around 6pm and fixed the issues. Logged a formal complaint via British Gas’ complaints process, got an automated email saying it’s been dealt with and I’ll hear back in the next 3 working days.

They will not maintain the system on a yearly basis until they think you have sludge and then you are landed with this bill on top on Homecare monthly payments.Icleaned the system myself ( without a power wash and without removing radiators) with a product costing less than £20, added inhibitor and everything is now fine. I have since cancelled the contract as it is best to save the money for a proper service from qualified local company when needed.Opinion - Homecare is an absolute rip off and a scam, I am annoyed I paid so much for it.

British Gas has complete contempt for customers - I've posted this because the Homecare complaint team wouldn't take my call.

I get a voice on Friday the 16th telling me the engineer was turning up at my house at 08.25 in the morning! I rang the Monday to rebook appointment being told they did try ringing me that day, ( no they didn’t) no voice message on my house phone, mob or even an email a text message to explain! Now it’s rebook for the 24th great the engineer turn up here a while yet there has been no problems with the boiler, he tells nothing wrong all good does a last check on boiler but it won’t turn on. Then me leaving him to it that the circuit board has gone! So comes to tell me his changed the circuit board no other problems, see you in an yr for next service!!!!Well 4th December I receive a bill a charge for the engineer doing the work, I ring customer service who are rude I tell them you con everyone, the call I have to say ended very shortly with how disgusted I am in them,  but now the 8th December the timer on my boiler doesn’t work I now wake to a freezing cold house with two very young children... or it stays on all day and night which isn’t good to do... people keep well away from them.

Had a break down with boiler today and all they could offer was engineer to come out NEXT WEDNESDAY that's exactly one week! Absolutely fraudulent! We pay monthly insurance incase of emergency - not had to use them in past 18 months but now when I have emergency the best they can offer is I wait one week without hearing and hot water!

1,"            We have had the British Gas Home care agreement for several years and the service over the past couple of years has been unacceptable.  The engineers often don't turn up, appointments are changed without being advised or they phone the evening before to advise that the engineer won't be coming.  I have again sat in for 5 hours this morning waiting for the engineer for him not to turn up. When i called customer service I was advised that the parts had been delivered to the wrong department and I should have received a phone call to let me know.  They also have our name wrong on the system and we have been trying to get this changed for 4 years - but they don't appear to know how to sort it.

If you want to reply a mail explaining the situation, it doesn't work! Also, live chat doesn't work on weekdays in the morning, which is ridiculous, too! And if you ring them... they will tell you loads of uninteresting stories about how they re-calculated your bill! I've paid the final bill, I've got mail confirmation that my balance is zero at 3 weeks after I've left them!Now, they come back telling me that I still have to pay something! I've told them in my last mail, (after their confirmation!) that I won't read anymore mails from British Gas and any letter will go straight away to the bin, unopened! And when you leave them, make sure you get confirmation mail and keep it saved long long time! Otherwise, they will take advantage of this and they will ask you for (unjustified) exit fees!

British Gas did not arrive or even call to advise me.

Booked online on 1st December for engineer to come and service boiler as no hot water; arranged for 6th December pm. Yep CANCELLED a few hours before today. Next available appointment is Tuesday 12th December. So with no hot water for 12 days and keep having to reset boiler. Comment from call handler; ""never mind, it must be annoying not being able to do the washing up""Joke. Don't work for British Gas if you are a woman as they are clearly in the stone age, having zero regard for women taking time from work and the contribution we make to the economy.  I am a working woman and would quite like a decent wash before heading off for a full days work. No compensation offered no apology no refund of the £60 up front payment. You're better saving the monthly amount for a private local gas man to check the boiler and sort out issues over the year than bother with this useless scheme.

I was so concerned about their bodged installation that I arranged for a British Gas engineer to check its safety. They confirmed that the NEST device to control my central heating had actually been incorrectly wired into the hot water connections of my manual controller. My central heating was still wired into the original manual thermostat.I was shocked that engineers arranged via First Utility did such a botched job. British Gas removed the NEST equipment on my behalf and installed their HIVE equipment instead which is now working perfectly.  I am very happy with the performance of the HIVE equipment and have full confidence that British Gas installed this safely and correctly.  Full marks to British Gas and to their engineer who was a star!

1,"            Well done British Gas you have just lost ANOTHER valued customer. I have had their homecare 400 package for years now but after one blunder after another I have cancelled my agreement. First of all the call centres are a joke. Ridiculous wait times of an hour an half and promises of call backs that never happen.They can't send out correct paperwork. I have been waiting, chasing phoning etc for my documents through the post confirming my agreement. They never turned up and when they did eventually turn up after my 6th phone call they had last year's date on. How very helpful.I put in a complaint about the ridiculous wait times on the phones and received a letter back saying they were looking into my complaint. After weeks I asked what was going on and they said the complaint had been closed down and logged as customer unhappy. And that was it. I didn't even get a reply.Price hikes every year and I'm sick of it. I have now gone with homeserve and I am paying half of what I paid with British Gas for the same cover and a lower excess.The last service visit I had got cancelled the day before and rescheduled for 2 months later. When the bloke turned up his equipment wasn't working properly. I genuinely fell sorry for the staff that work in the call centres. They get the brunt of unhappy customers and can only follow instructions and procedures put in place by dire management. I solely blame the customer service managers and executives for such dire, appalling and shameful customer service. Here is an idea - why don't you spend less money on flash adverts with a stupid penguin and instead invest that money into more customer service staff, better training and more engineers. AVOID!!!!!

I have had problems dealing with the local plumbing service provided by DynoRod under the terms of this scheme. I wasted 6 hours today waiting for their plumber, after taking a day off work. The plumber was booked to do work today in the time slot of 12pm to 6 pm. Nothing happened by 3pm and I called. The response was that he was on the way. He did not arrive. I called again and BG said that the plumber had the right to turn up until 6pm.  Shortly after Dyno called to say that the plumber was held up and would be with us by 8pm. Ridiculous. I selected another day for them to come but I'm not holding my breath. Poor service with no empathy from BG operators. They need to review their service alliance with dyno - it does not work well. Of course they are happy to take my Homecare monthly payments. This is no way to treat paying customers, and BG should make sure that suitable resources are set up prior to launching a service scheme(scam?)

Then the system started to loose pressure and I did as I was advised. To contact the engineer who fitted the boiler if there was an issue within the first 30 days. I did this and he was on a job and suggested I rang the homecare number.I did this and was told that all because I still had heating and hot water this was NOT a priority and have waited patiently for an engineer to call. This was for 08:00 yo 13:00 today 4th December2017. I had a call at nearly 12:30 to advised that the engineer was not coming and that I would have to book another appointment. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the manager would ring me within the next 24 hours.I have a new appointment but I think that your service is well below what is acceptable.When the salesman was telling us how good British Gas are with service etc he failed to mention that it is ok to wait for a week for an engineer and that I have to fit in with your schedules. I have had to wait in today for an engineer that did not arrive and now I have to do the same on Thursday hoping that your not too busy to call.And to wait up to 24 hours for a manager to ring back is appalling service, do you that many issues that a call cannot be made sooner?Even BG website wont take complints!!!!!!!!!!Very poor service 1/10

This on a Homecare 400 policy!...... with a BG installed back boiler that has up to now required a new condensate pump, fan, pcb, the boiler control on the electric fire provided with back boiler is not working, led unit on fire has failed and every time there is the suggestion of frost, the condensate pipe freezes which has led to me getting the pipe fitted (not by BG!) with a trace heater and insulation at a cost of £250......Unbelievable!6.40pm BG rang to say they would 'try' to get the emergency engineer who works the night shift out to us......we shall see.22.25pm still no sign of BG.23.00pm BG engineer arrived, spent an hour attempting to find cause of failure without success, arranged for further 'diagnostics' tomorrow, he was sympathetic toward our ongoing situation and appreciated we face difficult choices with regard to the boiler given the long-standing catalogue of problems.  The boiler was only installed in 2012!This am another engineer came, checked everything, believes failed boiler control on the electric fire has caused the boiler to fail, has ordered a new one and is hoping to fit tomorrow first thing......wish us luck as this is our fourth day without hot water and heating and it's not good!Josh BG's engineer arrived at 8.45am fitted the new BCU to boiler......and we now have heating!  Apparently he is one of the few engineers who has previous experience with the Baxi Bermuda HE BBU.  Perhaps BG should have sent him in the first place to have saved us four days without a boiler and saved us and themselves from a lot of grief.  Thanks again Josh!

How much have my parents paid for this disgraceful and uncaring ""service"", £853 per year, NO this is not a typing error my parents have paid £853 for this.  This is in addition to the 2 weeks it took to have an engineer to unsuccesfully attempt to repair their dishwasher and the unsucessful attempt to diagnose and rectify a wiring fault in their lighting circuit, one which a local electrician sorted out in about 20 minutes.  I would have rated this zero stars but unfortunately the site wouldn't let me proceed without giving them at least one star.

I was then put on a priority register with British Gas due to my illnesses it also meant that they had to come out and take a metre reading every 6 months since being on the priority register this has only been done three times. I've had many failed appointments by British Gas not turning up to read my meter. I've just learnt that every missed appointment £30 should be deducted from The Bill and this has not been done even though I've been told it should be done automatically. I've been trying to leave British Gas for some time I've been continuously asking them to send me out a final bill and an accurate one this is not happened. I should also be on an Economy 7 metre and I've just found out I'm on a standard tariff the most expensive one. I've had cancer and DVT which is pretty much taken over my life I can't believe British Gas are doing this to me. I've not had the strength to do anything about it as yet and the medication I'm on pretty much has me sleeping all day this is really getting me down and adding to my illness and causing me depression but do you think they care I just want to get rid of British Gas and go to another provider.

First time engineer came out said part needed fitting.  Went away, ordered the part and rebooked to fit.  After the fitting next day, same error message came up  so contacted them again and another engineer came out and said another part required.  He went away ordered the part and we rebooked to have this fitted.  Day after this fitting, same error message comes up so contacted British Gas again and they agreed to arrange a another engineer to come out.  Waited all day for the appointment no one came, contacted British Gas and they said they had been busy with other priority calls and cancelled the appointment without notifying us (despite us pre-booking a few days beforehand and confirming.  Agreed to call us back - Booked another appointment and the engineer contacted us on transit to say it sounded like we needed a Siemens engineer to assess the job as British Gas had been unable to fix.  So he cancelled the job and we waited for the next appointment.  No joy so we contacted British Gas again and they agreed to come back to us within 48 hours - an appointment was booked but this was some days later.  Engineer came and said several new parts required and he would pass back to British Gas to authorise and order within 48 hours.  72 hours later we contacted British Gas and after holding on for 45 minutes were told that we had to go through to the parts department and this closed at 5.00 pm, advised to call back later because they were unable to pass on our details or arrange a call back.  Called back today - held on for 20 minutes before speaking to customer service who went around in circles for 45 minutes and advised that we had to contact Siemens direct - we informed British Gas that we had no telephone number for them or reference number and we were trying to ascertain wait times - after 45 minutes the call was cut off mid way through.  Rang back again and held on for 30 minutes before speaking to someone else at British Gas who informed us that we needed their specialist manufacturer team who had no direct number and we would have to repeat the whole story again and wait in a queue.

Failed to appreciate that a claimed meter reading after 10 days occupancy could not be correct given the genuine, photographed meter reading 6 weeks after occupancy was less than the one claimed. The whole experience was shambolic and very distressing to my son, the occupier, who has complex disabilities. He kept receiving final bills with threats of debt collection despite me being repeatedly told that the account had been 'locked'. It was an awful experience for both of us. It took 6 months to acheive a resolution. Customer centredness does not exist within British Gas as an organisation. Most staff who responded to telephone calls tried to be very helpful however did not have the authority or resources to enable resolution to be achieved. Eventually, they gave my son £100.00 as a 'good will gesture' - a farce, there is not any good will in Bristish Gas. The company is an absolute disgrace!

Do you wonder why the jobs are sourced out to India or Philippines etc?They ought to be sacked!!! And give the jobs to those who wants the job

5,"            After an unfulfilled appointment by an engineer, a follow up phone call to British Gas to see why no one had fulfilled the 12 - 6 appointment and we had been given NO explanation, I was told our postcode was not registered with B Gas. We have had a Home Care agreement with them for years! The young man was rude and unhelpful. I rang again to be told someone would come later in the evening.Andy did come and restored all my faith in British Gas. He was polite and concerned to point out the problem as he saw it. Because he had not got the part with him, he said he would return the next day. This he did and spent time explaining what he had done. British Gas could do to employ more like Andy

1,"            Absolutely disgusted at my first time dealing with this company. My elderly and hard of hearing mother of 87 was left to deal with British Gas and ended up upset and confused so I stepped in to help. I had made numerous phone calls to customer services today to have been put on hold for 20 minutes each time to be asked the same things, to be put on hold yet again and finally the phone being put down on me. To say I was not happy is an understatement. She has been promised a new washing machine no word from British gas to say when so she has stayed in every day worrying if she dare leave the house. I rang to find out simply when the machine would be delivered to no avail. I was finally asked to speak to a manager PAUL who I found to be rude, unsympathetic to my mother's situation to be told here's a number you have to ring it yourself!! I asked him what my mother would do if she didn't have me to ring on her behalf and he couldn't care less. She pays a fortune a month for this care plan and if this is the level of customer service for an elderly customer British Gas ought to be downright ashamed of themselves. I still have no idea what is happening with the washing machine 😡

Too big job for British Gas apparently, simply was told to use a 3rd party company ! After managing to purchase 3 flue kits to make a complete length ( to ensure all flue length replaced) and spending £350 I managed to find a local a safe gas engineer locally (ex British Gas) who had completed the task within 2 hours next day! So, who need all ""this n that"" fancy policy of  British Gas at £240 per year? When you have a dedicated local self employed engineer who can deal with such tasks easily ? No frills , job done at a margin of the annual cost including gas safe certificate!! Please be aware before signing up for Homecare!

1,"            I have been a British Gas customer for 45 years and have had a Home Care Four contract for many years. Today Tuesday 28th November was the final straw that broke the camels back, British Gas called to say my planned boiler service which was due to happen today would now not take place until the 4th February 2018.I spoke to the service team and Manager for 45 minutes this morning and explained why my boiler had to be serviced before the end of December and after many minutes on hold was advised that only the planning department had the authority to allocate engineers and they are saying that they cannot provide an engineer before the date given.I have been advised I will get a £30.00 fee for the fact they failed to attend their appointment today and a further £50.00 if my boiler is not serviced before the expiry of the contract in January however I believe compensation should be considerably higher as they have broken their contract which specifically states boilers will be serviced annually.Fortunately I have found an alternative company for the servicing of my boiler and their monthly fee is £10.00 a month less expensive than BG.Next decision is who to switch too for my gas supply !!!!!

1,"            I have had no heating or hot water at home since 4th November. There have been a catalogue of failures from British Gas in terms of communications, false promises and lies and I am still left with no heating or hot water. And my partner suffers from mental health issues which have been exacerbated by the recent death of his mother.I have spoken to more than 18 agents in the past 36 hours and have made no progress. Details of these calls are captured below:The details:I have had no heating or hot water in my property since 4th November. A British Gas engineer attended the property on 6th November and determined we needed a new gas valve which he ordered. My mother-in-law subsequently died unexpectedly and I had to rearrange the appointment to replace the valve for 27th November because we were grieving and could not guarantee when we would be in the property to allow a visit. Friday 24th:I had a text confirmation from you of the appointment on Friday 24th for a period between 8am and 1pm on 27th. Sunday 26th 17:00:I called to reconfirm the appointment and ensure the part would come along with the engineer on Sunday 26th November at 5pm. Ken, the agent I spoke to, told me this was confirmed and said he'd put a note on the appointment for it to be early in the day given the circumstances as my partner suffers from mental health issues and is particularly suffering at the moment given the recent loss of his mother.Monday 27th:11am no one had turned up and so I called and was assured someone would be with us before 1pm. At 11:30am you called my partner to shift the appointment to between 12pm and 6pm with no explanation for why.12pm: I called to speak to a manager, Sophie, who put the phone down on me.2pm: I then spoke to Ben who marked our appointment as critical and said that would guarantee it would happen on 27th before 6pm. 2:30pm: I then spoke to another agent who said Charlie, the engineer, was sleeping until 4pm but he would then attend our property before 6pm. 5:30pm I spoke to another agent who told me that Charlie was en route to my property as of 17:07pm and should therefore be arriving shortly. 6pm there was still no sign of an engineer and so my partner called again and was on the phone for an hour. We were told someone would be with us between 12pm and 6pm today, 28th November. I said this was unacceptable and spoke to a manager named Ouna who said she would book an appointment for 28th November between 8am and 10am but also make it an emergency, given the mental health issues my partner suffers from, so that someone would be out to us by 10pm on 27th November. 8:15pm I reconfirmed that we were listed as an emergency case with a separate agent.10pm: No one had arrived so I called again and was told it was an emergency but it would be dealt with some time between 10pm and 7am and there were 'lots of jobs'. 28th November5am: having not slept, I spoke to Gayle who told me that the job had been registered as 'complete' but was still listed as open. She said the engineer who had been en route at 17:07pm had arrived at the property at 23:47. She also said that the 8am-10am slot booked for 28th did not have any part associated with it but there was a second appointment today for us between 12pm and 6pm. She said the dispatch centre was closed until 7:30am but she would ensure that someone would call me by 8am to tell me what was going on.8am I had heard nothing so I called Chris. Chris could offer me no solutions and told me the dispatch centre was inexplicably closed, and he had no idea what to suggest given two bookings today and the fact he couldn't get hold of the engineer. Chris spoke to his team leader who also could offer no suggestions other than to call back at 9am when hopefully the dispatch centre will be open. He promised me he would call me back by 9am.9am: no call from Chris9:15am: Steve from Leicester called to say Charlie would attend between 12pm and 6pm today. I explained the background and he said he’d see what he could do and call me back as Charlie starts work at 10am today.9:25am: I get a call from Chris at British Gas who puts the phone down on me.

1,"            We had a new pump fitted by a British Gas engineer just under 2 years ago.On the 24/11 it started making high pitched noises and was very hot so for safety reasons I turned the boiler off and arranged for an engineer visit.My card details were taken over the phone to secure the appointment and I was assured that no money would be taken from my account unless parts were needed.The engineer came on the Thursday and basically just turned on the boiler on and let it run and said it was just basically an air lock, while he was here I gave him a permit ticket to park and a cup of tea which he happily drank while fiddling around on his laptop; He was here for around 15mins he repaired nothing and no parts were used. I was very surprised and disappointed to find that the very next day British Gas had taken £50 from my account. I believe that my home care cover has a £50.00 excess but this is for repairs and parts. Not for just turning a boiler on!.I called BG’s service team today and after speaking to them and explaining the situation they said they would not remove the charge because the engineer had visited the property. I have been a British Gas customer for many years and just find the whole service disappointing on this occasion.I then told the customer service representative to put me through to the  homecare cancellation team. Upon speaking to them again there was no movement; so have had no choice but to cancel my agreement.If I was a customer that constantly called engineers out with faults to my boiler I could understand the excess being charged, but I have only called an engineer out twice in over 2years and be charged for an engineer just turning on my boiler I think on this occasion the charged could of been waivered as a good will gesture.I took a day off work unpaid so have lost a days wages, I had an appointment booked from 12 - 6, it says on you website that the engineer will call you in plenty of time so that you can get on with your day; he called me 10mins before and got to me at 5.45pm, so that basically it was a whole day wasted. I gave the engineer a permit to park which costs me £4, in order to make sure he didn’t get a parking fine. I feel like I’ve gone out of my way to accommodate this visit . This visit has cost me personally around £184.00 inc your excess fee of £50.00. And I have now been forced to cancel my cover when this could’ve been so easily rectified with a little bit of understanding and compassion from BG’s side. I feel very let down and disappointed.I have emailed the customer complaints team, who knows if I’ll get a response back seeing as they are not too bothered about retaining their customers anyway....

1,"            I have been a homecare customer for several years and always have an annual boiler service carried out under the terms of my agreement with British Gas. I booked an annual service online as usual on 30 September and got an appointment allocated for 28 November - a longer wait than normal but I accepted it nevertheless. Got a phone call this morning (27 November) to say that tomorrow’s appointment was cancelled and would need to be rescheduled. I wasn’t happy but asked when my new appointment would be and was told it would be in February 2018! I said I wouldn’t accept this unreasonable treatment and asked to speak to a supervisor. Oddly enough, there wasn’t one available but someone would phone me back ... in the next 24 hours! This means that the annual service agreed in my contract with British Gas is now biennial. My boiler was last serviced in October 2016 and won’t be looked at again until 2018. I have made a formal complaint but won’t hold my breath as they give themselves 8 working weeks to respond. “Looking after my world” or what? This is the second issue I have had to make a formal complaint about this month so needless to say I shan’t be renewing. Any good alternatives out there?28th November update. Yesterday I was promised a phone from a supervisor within 24 hours....:surprise, surprise, not a dickie bird. Love the customer care British Gas!Emailed Iain Conn CEO of Centrica, parent company of British Gas, but not only have I not received a reply (despite a reminder) but not even an acknowledgement. This says it all - they take your hard-earned money, provide a more than shoddy service in return and couldn’t give a stuff about their customers. It’s time the customer fought back by shaming those responsible and voting with their feet!

I was advised an engineer would be with me today, so i've stayed home from work just for him not to show. When i called at 4.30 p.m., i was at first told he'd be here after he finished the job he was on. When i asked the operator to double check, he came back with the resposne that the engineer was attending other emergencies and would not get to me today. This means i'll be left all weekend with no heating, which is not good enough when i pay allot of money for the service. 1 star as the handler was very unhelpful, and british gas obviously do not care enough about their customers to bother to communicate with us and do what we pay them for when you have an emergency.

I had a phone call today, which I assumed to be confirmation of the annual service in two days time (which had already been delayed at your request).  To be met with 'We need to reschedule your service until February'.  FEBRUARY, you must be joking, that is 3 months away.  I could understand, and quite accept, that if due to overload/holidays/sickness etc. a week or two delay may be required, but 3 months!  This is clearly first of all, not acceptable and secondly, bad management if you cannot plan ahead for servicing when contracts have already been made and accepted, meaning you already knew how much planned work was in the pipeline.I pay £230 a year for a service that I am not getting from you, a company up until now I had great respect and confidence in,  £230 is a lot when you are a pensioner, but I pay it in the obviously false belief that I am dealing with a professional and efficient company.  Surely you are in breach of contract?  What happens if the boiler breaks down, do you now say, "" Sorry, but it hasn't been maintained properly""  What if I just said to you, ""Sorry, we are a bit hard up for the next three months, so won't be paying you"", I doubt that you would find that acceptable.I am absolutely disgusted with British Gas, and disappointed too.  Not that this, or the other 78,000 complaints will make any difference, but I will be writing to the ombudsman to register my complaint, and will no doubt 'mention' you on a few sites as well.

I waited in all day but still no engineer.So I phoned British Gas and they said the engineer never got told of the job-AGAIN.They said the job was booked on their system but the engineer did not know about it because one of their departments made a mistake when forwarding the job. I told them I have been for 3 weeks without heating. But they said they haven't got any more appointments for 3 weeks. I said I have waited 3 weeks already and boiler has not been fixed because they keep messing me about.

3,"            Our boiler has developed a few problems over the years such as the flame goes out each day and the pressure drops. We usually just reset it ourselfs but recently it has refused to reset. We have a service plan for it all  but lets not get into that. The first engineer  came bouncing into our house. Some young guy who was all talk and he proceeded to bashed the boiler to pieces with the hammer and left us with no hot water. He came down stairs with a broken part in his arms and said he would order a new one. So naturally not being a boiler engineer we just agreed. One week later the other engineer fitted the part and it did not solve anything. We had another day with no hot water in week 2  so then we had to book a third engineer.  This guy came within a week or so and examined all the boiler top to bottom and found 3 additional minor faults previously missed by the other engineers. Tbh the other engineers did not do a proper job imo.  Overall it took 3 weeks to fix but it now works. So i would like to thank this engineer very much. Imo though british gas needs to be careful which engineers they employ.(From the tenants at the property who had to deal with the engineers).  i will find the landlords  customer number later👍

2,"            On  the 16th November, I tried to amend the time of a Boiler Service scheduled for 10 am to 12 on the 21st November. I offered any other time that same day. The reason for asking for the change? Since making the first appointment available months previously, my wife had sustained a very bad fall followed ten days later by a stroke. Coincidentally, hospital and doctor appointments were allocated to us at short notice to coincide with  the scheduled two hour slot on the 21st November. I had to accompany my wife to relay information etc.The options given by British Gas were either to get someone else to be in the house when I was at the hospital or reschedule the Boiler Service for January 2018. (I pointed out that ""the someone else"" could not answer questions or know where the controls were etc)I have been a loyal customer for many years but I will be moving on at the first opportunity. My wife's health is important to me!UpdateBritish Gas 'phoned me on the 20th November to cancel the next day's Boiler Service arranged two months previously. Apparently there were "" a lot of people without heating and hot water"" (Meanwhile I had gone to a lot of trouble to arrange for a reliable friend to be available for the visit by British Gas) The  first available alternative was the 29th January 2018.Why can't Britsh Gas forecast likely demand and have sufficient engineers in place? Also why schedule a Boiler Service for November rather than in the spring or summer?I have now terminated the contract.

By 4pm no one had turned So I called British Gas to ask if the engineer was still coming,  I was assured he was,At 6PM still no engineer, I called British Gas Again, the chap told me my appointment had been rescheduled, I asked why no one had even bothered call me, He said they had called me three times, This is where it gets even worse, So I asked he what number they had for me, He called out a wrong mobile number, He could not tell we where they got this number from or why no one checked my account for the correct number  (bearing in mind I had this service in place for 7 years) So he checked my account and Guess What? my correct number was on there. If just one person had even bothered to check my Account, they would have my number in seconds, Obviously a scam when an engineer chooses to bugger off and leave a customer hanging, even worse when my appointment was deemed priority because the heating in my 3 year old bedroom was out, unscrupulous people, who could not care a Dam about their customers working for a Unscrupulous Company, Shame on you British Gas

1,"            I have previously used British Gas Homecare Landlords cover for 3 properties which are adjacent to each other.  All properties have new Worcester Bosch boilers and require about 30 minutes attention annually, at which time a CP12 is issued.   Each year British Gas attempt to increase the price way above inflation but bearing no relation to the situation. This year the price increased 7% 14% and 16% on each property and when I questioned this I was met with absolute silence.  Further more the prices have now increased far above that offered to a new customer, what happened to customer loyalty??!!  I cannot write here the number of times that I have been promised some action or other, either by phone or chatline, and nothing happens!!!  Be very careful if you choose this cover, the come and buy me price will not last, and if you do need to talk to anyone it's made so difficult that in the end you probably will give up, life is too short!

One of which is to book the annual boiler service  Telephoned and the earliest they could book was the 20th of November we dealt with it and today I get a call from my mother to say they have changed this to the earliest day in February. After 40 minutes on the telephone with British Gas I get told that if my mother has an a emergency they will be there in hours I am not that confident as the last time she needed them without my intervention she would have waited and waited because that is what the older generation does.

1,"            ANNOYED!  Yesterday the hot water tank needed a new thermostat but the guy didn't have the part so said he would come back first thing this morning at 8:30.  He said we could use the system manually for a short period.  My partner took time off work this morning and waited and waited.  At 9:45 I got in touch with them - the guy is off sick!  THEN WHY THE FECK DIDNT YOU TELL US!? what a waste of holiday time.  When was someone planning on calling?  What about everyone else he was due to see today - were they also just supposed to sit around waiting for no one to turn up?  Anyways they needed the guy to return the part for another engineer to use which wasn't going to happen today - I said I needed an engineer tonight, the bloke turned off my hot water tank without telling me even though he said we could use it manually so now I have no hot water.  Got told a new part is coming but again wont arrive till tomorrow morning so apparently a bloke is now coming between 8-10 tomorrow...so Either me or my partner have to take more time off.  What is wrong with these people? why do they not respect my time.  What a complete joke of a company - what the feck do I pay for?!  Got offered £30 compensation, doesn't even slightly pay for my time off, I declined as ask for the complaint to be escalated.  They have 48 hours to reply and a further 8 weeks to resolve this.  I have no issues taking this external to the Ombudsman if this issue isn't fixed ASAP or if they continue the sh!t show service from today and continue to mess me about - people have children, you can't just leave them without hot water.  The very least they can do it waive the £60 excess.  Remains to be seen if they bother to show up tomorrow at all.  I'll be calling first thing to check someone if in fact coming, I'd recommend you do the same if you're ever promised someone is coming/have an appointment.  Frustrated and annoyed.  I have no hot water and they don't seem to appreciate I can't turn up to work stinking.  Paying for homecare 4 isn't cheap and it's making me question why I bother.  Reading other reviews it seems like I'm not the only one suffering this absolutely shocking service.

It began shortly after moving when they cancelled my Gas direct debit not once but twice - they blamed that on a 'computer glitch' which is fair enough, we all have these issues occasionally, but twice?!!!  Had a few months of peace before facing another drama, this time with my electricity account (electricity meter stopped working). They had over estimated my electricity usage so they supposedly credited my account £160.63 but have then proceeded to overcharge me so I'm now owing them £62??? It's an obvious mistake but my attempts to get someone to explain/rectify this has been an exercise in futility and has left me feeling like I'm being royally fleeced. When you eventually get through to the complaints dept they are nice & friendly and I'm sure they must have a very difficult job dealing with the hordes of disgruntled customers, however, I have been told so many contradictory things & have stressed so much over this that I've now held my hands up and surrendered. I'm leaving, never to return and will warn anyone if you value your sanity, peace of mind etc. etc, do not use British Gas. Life is just too short!

Today, there were two cars outside the house, the doorbell was working and the engineer failed to call in advance or when he was sat outside the house. BG have two telephone numbers and a current email address. I pay £740 per year for the privilege of this disgraceful service. Before you enter into any agreement think very carefully. I have written to the Head of Service at British Gas on all 4 occasions, to date she has not bothered to reply.

1,"            A nightmare is the only term that can describe my experience with British Gas. They were the existing supplier in my new flat, and it took a month for them to even believe my gas meter reading since it was so much lower than their estimates. Everyone was extremely polite - but unable to fix things, creating a lot of stress for me. I can't complain about anyone, they were all very friendly - but there just didn't seem to be a system in place for quickly and efficiently dealing with large discrepancies. Eventually, I asked for a formal complaint. This seems to have escalated it to someone able to do something about my issue - recording the meter as being a new one the day I moved in, which fixed my issue. I got a first bill and all was correct. But I feel so much sympathy for the previous tenant, since obviously incorrect readings had been used in billing for some time.I've switched away, and am currently awaiting a final bill and refund of my overpaid direct debits. It's been a bit over a week, but I have no idea how long this should take. I'll chase them up in another week or so?It is also worth noting that they do not support gender-neutral titles on accounts.Again, I want to express my utmost appreciation for everyone I dealt with at British Gas - the people were all very friendly and great. A* for the people, it's just too bad they didn't have the tools needed to fix issues like this.UPDATE - I'm dropping this to one star from two as tonight I got a letter from debt collectors apparently related to time before I moved in, addressed to 'the occupier' - yeah, okay, I had enough trouble getting my own billing sorted out. The last thing I want, or is acceptable, is to have debt collectors harass me when they know full well when I moved in and that I have no connection to previous tenants. The nightmare of British Gas continues, when I thought it was all finally over and fixed and done...

1,"            We have had a HomeCare Agreement with British Gas for several years to cover a coal-effect gas fire. Each year it was serviced between May and July the last service being in June 2016. This year the reminder to book a service did not arrive until September and the earliest date available was in November. The day before the service was due we received a phone call to tell us that because of a high volume of emergency call-outs our service visit would have to be delayed. I was told that the earliest date available would be in January 2018. Since British Gas say that such an appliance should be serviced annually I find their performance entirely unsatisfactory. As a minimum I shall be seeking a cancellation of the contract and refund of premiums paid as I shall need to get the service done by someone else as soon as possible. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that I would receive a call within the next 1.5 hours. Four hours later I am still waiting. I cannot recommend this organization to anyone.

However when I mentioned that the gas fire did not always ignite at first attempt I was offered a p.m. (12-6) appointment for 14 Nov. Will have to wait and see what the excuse will be on Tuesday as I am not counting on a visit from an engineer.  It is not pleasant sitting in the cold for 6 hours when one is 76 years old.

1,"            To be honest even giving them 1 star is to much. Had a problem with my heating so took out the homecare package because it seemed good value for money, the British gas guy turned up and what a disgrace he was. Looked very unprofessional and his uniform was a embarrassment due to the way he wore it. Was in my house for about 10 minutes and basically condemned my boiler because a few issues about the surround and flue because it was a old back boiler so he refused to work on it. Not a problem but 12 months previously I had a service from British gas and this was no problem then. The guy has no interest and because it was near the end of the day he basically couldn't be bothered and condemned it. But since I have had a local plumber out and he has fixed my problem what was a faulty water pump and he checked my boiler over and made it clear was safe to use just old. So please be aware if I didn't have my wits about me I could off been spending thousands on a boiler I didn't need!

British gas have a bizarre system whereby they send you separate gas and electricity final statements and then tell you that they are not really separate but final accounts for combined gas and electricity and that you ony take notice of the latest date final statement as the other final statement isn't really a final statement at all. When they state 'gas' they really mean gas and electricity and when they state 'electricity' they really mean gas and electricity. Confused?  I certainly am. Never again British Gas

I said no and asked for a second opinion.  After a long cold weekend where my tenants and three young children two of whom are disabled had struggled with the cold the second opinion was that the parts are available and the boiler can be repaired.

1,"            I have Homecare 400 and when our Central Heating refused to fire up after the summer British Gas came out and said that there was a blockage in the system caused by previous loft insulation getting into the header tank and we would need a £700 power flush that we would have to pay for as this was not covered on the HomeCare plan. The engineer didn't recommend it as our back boiler was old and probably wouldn't survive the power flush, even though it had passed it's annual service the previous day with no comment. British Gas offered £700 off the cost of a new Combi Boiler as a power flush was included in the installation and would solve any problems.We were charged £3500 for a new boiler and it was installed two weeks ago. Today is when the problems started. My wife received a text from British Gas saying that they were receiving no information from the installed Boiler IQ. I rang and a very helpful lady asked if I had registered to which I said I had and she then found my registration on the system. She then asked me to check if the white box on the back of my router was plugged in correctly to which I replied there wasn't one. She then asked if the diagnostics box on the new boiler was working to which I again had to say there wasn't one. The fitters had charged £49 for something that they knew they had not fitted. My wife and I then started checking the other items on the quote that we had paid in full and we came to the power flush for which we had been charged £260 and was one of the main reasons we had had a new boiler fitted. I now quote British Gas, 'It's important to remove sludge before you install a new boiler onto an old system. Otherwise it could build up and damage your new boiler. A powerflush is the most effective way of cleaning a system and will make sure that your new boiler can perform as efficiently as possible.' The leaflet then goes on to explain what is done during a powerflush. None of that was done during our boiler installation but we were still charged £260 for it. The biggest laugh at all is that by bypassing the header tank all of our radiators are working well so it looks like all that was needed was the pipe from the header tank replacing, work that was covered under our Homecare agreement, but we were forced into having a whole new system. We went with British Gas because we thought they were trustworthy, THEY ARE NOT!!!! If you have a fitter called Andy Shepherd come to fit your boiler ensure that you stand over him the entire time and make him explain exactly what he is doing at all times and then when it comes time to pay ensure you go over the entire quote with him and get him to demonstrate that he has done all the work he was supposed to do with evidence prior to paying. What happened to us was fraud, plain and simple and British Gas should be ashamed.

1,"            They disconnected our central heating boiler at annual service as its ""at risk"" of ""BECOMING unsafe"".. this phrase in the legislation  is too vague a covers them for all eventualities. The practicalities are ..it was running perfectly and no gas or carbon monoxide were being emitted into the room. Kind of like saying Your car is at risk of crashing if you get behind the wheel... meanwhile the coldest night of the year below zero. The engineer departs telling me i need a new boiler...The next day they arrive mob handed with an area manager and another engineer after removing the cover and starting it up the say they can smell gas.. (I can't .. stood next to them.) they do not have a gas detector to prove it. They say there is a small amount of carbon monoxide leaking around the heat exchanger unit.. possibly due to a leaking gasket which they have brought a replacement for. They fit it. Fumes are still detected.... after a moments head scratching he tightens the screws around the heat exchanger.  no more fumes detected... So. 24 hours without heat and the threat of condemning our perfectly working boiler for the want of a screwdriver and ten seconds! has caused me so much stress that I am going to cancel our homecare agreement which I have paid £44 a month for for the last nine years. Bank the money in future and use a local trusted engineer.  The service engineers on homecare are always going to find some little thing to get you to buy a new boiler. Most are easily repaired for less than the cost of a homecare agreement per month.  AVOID

1,"            I had booked an appointment to have a quote for a new central heating gas boiler to be fitted. On the due date, I received an email confirming that I could expect the BG Heating Adviser to arrive between 1pm and 3pm.Because of this appointment, my wife had put off a visit from a close friend and her child who wanted to visit before the end of the school half-term holiday. Come 3pm and no sign of or contact from BG.By 4pm, I had had enough and called BG to find out what was going on.Whilst not being impolite, the person to whom I spoke was not particularly helpful and suggested that the engineer could have been held up in traffic; when I asked why he could not 'phone to let us know that there would be a delay she replied that drivers are not allowed to make calls whilst driving. My obvious response to this was that perhaps he should stop, put the brake on and turn off the ignition! before calling!The call ended when I said that I would cancel the visit altogether and look for another installer.I then decided to call the customer complaints number. I explained the situation and after much hoo-hah, was told that a complaint would be ""raised"" on my behalf. I then asked to whom I could write at the highest level in the organisation  to further my complaint and was advised that I would be passed on to a relevant department. After quite a long delay somebody came on the line and I once again explained my complaint. He told me that he had no idea why I had been passed to his department! My response was "" British Gas organisation is a joke!"" By now I was past anger and was becoming amused because if you don'tlaugh you'll cry. I have been a loyal customer of BG for many years and have avoided advice to ""switch"" even though I knew I might save money.This experience has now made the decision for me - goodbye to British Gas!

1,"            Don't waste your money on this total rip off scam. In our case British Gas charged me an additional £90 or £99 repair charge on top of our monthly direct debit to repair our boiler. I was out when the engineer called but when I got back home I found that the engineer had condemned the boiler, claiming that it was unsafe, and and cut the gas line to it to stop us from using it. He then claimed that the parts needed to repair it were not longer available. Withing 5 minutes of him leaving our house I had found the parts online and over 6 different UK boiler parts suppliers, they were readily available from stock for next day delivery! I had an independent gas safe plummer look at the boiler and he confirmed that the parts were readily available but would cost more than the boiler was worth and that was probably why British Gas claimed they were not available. He also stated that there as no reason to condemn and disconnect the boiler as the part in question was a little corroded but was still fine to use and would be for a year or two yet. When I contacted British Gas to complain they offered no apology and simply stated that the parts are not available from ""their suppliers"". Now that's the crux of the con, they will probably own the suppliers and delete any parts from stock that are becoming expensive so that they only ever carry out repairs that are economically profitable for them. In our case one of the parts would cost around £500 so of course they would loose out if they supplied and fitted that part so instead it is removed from the ""available parts list"" for that boiler protecting British Gas from losses.Today British Gas Homecare will be visiting a house we have been renting out but are now preparing to sell. After not being used for a few months the boiler won't ignite so they are coming to repair it today. I've already checked and all parts are readily available for next day delivery so lets see what happens!If your boiler is getting on a bit my advice would be to have a new boiler fitted on a 10 year warranty deal as it will cost you less per month than Homecare does and if the boiler can't be repaired during the 10 year warranty period they replace the whole boiler with a new one.

1,"            Unfortunately, I do have to agree with what most others say. A total shambles of an organisation, although their engineers have always been pretty good. It's the scheduling and planning departments that really need to get a grip. Here's my ongoing saga, as yet unresolved.The service to fix a broken fridge/freezer has been shambolic and an embarrassment to me as the landlord of a property, and should be an embarrassment to British Gas too. First of all the tenants had to put up with a fridge/freezer that wasn't working for a whole week because an engineer wasn't available immediately. The engineer then came out on 22nd September and managed to fix it temporarily whilst he ordered a new part. On Monday 9th October, the WRONG engineer was sent to the property who didn't have the new part and so couldn't install it. An appointment with the correct engineer with the spare part was scheduled for 27th October. I called British Gas on the 25th October and spent 30 minutes on the phone to get reassurances that the correct engineer had been booked and was coming complete with part on the appointed day. The customer service employee was unable to get through to the parts department to clarify, but assured me that the right engineer had definitely been booked and would be there at the allotted time. My tenants called at 8.58 on 27th October to ask at what time the engineer was likely to arrive, but the customer service agent was unable to clarify. Finally at 10.19 on the 27th October, the actual morning of appointment, my tenants received a call saying that the engineer needed  to do the job is actually on holiday and the part is locked in his van, and so once again they have had to rearrange. If this was a comedy show, you honestly couldn't make it up. W1A, eat your heart out! I spent more than 30 minutes on the phone on Friday 27th October to try and find out what was going on and why they couldn't seem to match the correct engineer with the correct part. The correct engineer was then supposedly booked once again for the morning of Monday 30th October. Then at lunchtime on Friday 27th October they called me back asking if they could move the appointment they'd only just booked to the afternoon slot on Monday 30th, as the said engineer was already booked on a job that morning. I said that would be ok, thinking at least they must have the correct man booked for the job this time. On the afternoon of Monday 30th October, my tenants called to say that the engineer still hadn't turned up, so I called British Gas to chase up. Apparently the planning or scheduling department had decided to move the correct engineer away from the job and decided to give it back to the wrong engineer who had previously turned up on the 9th October. ARGHHHH! As a result he had rejected the job. I was furious, and called up on Monday 30th Oct to find out what was going on. Customer Service apologised profusely and promised me that the correct engineer and the only one in the area who could do the job, had once again been booked to arrive some time between 8 and 9am on the morning of Tuesday 31st October, and this time notes had been put on the booking for nobody to change the engineer. By 9am on the Tuesday morning, an engineer still hadn't arrived. I called up customer services again who told me that he was definitely coming, but had been delayed. At 10.30am when he still hadn't arrived I decided to call up again, and was this time told the engineer wouldn't now be coming as promised because of a problem with the part.I called customer services yet again on the afternoon of Wednesday 1st November, suggesting they should maybe write the appliance off if they were incapable of fixing the issue. However, I was informed that they cannot do that unless they book yet another engineer visit, and so we might as well have another attempt at sending the correct engineer to either fit the part or write the appliance off. After a few enquiries, the customer service agent found out that the reason the engineer wasn't able to attend as promised on the 31st October, was because the part had been sent back to a different department. He has therefore once again booked the engineer for the morning of Monday 13th November and promises me that notes all over the account inform all departments not to move the engineer. He has also spoken to the parts department who assure us that the right man will turn up with the right part on Monday 13th November. I can't say I feel too confident about the outcome myself. Still, I can always write a book about my experience.Latest Update: On the 6th November I called up to make sure everything was still ok for the 13th November, and guess what? No sign of a booking. So very apologetically they booked it in yet again (5th time) for 9th November, which was the earliest available appointment for the specific engineer, for 12-6pm. They assure me the right engineer with the right part had definitely been booked. I pointed out yet again that it's a big job and so needed to be at 12pm rather than later on. Then at 12pm on the 9th November nobody turned up. By 1pm nobody was there. The clock moved to 2pm and no engineer. I called customer services. They confirmed that the right engineer had been booked and they sent him an e-mail to call me and let me know when he would be there. At 4pm there had been no call and no engineer. I called customer services again who called the engineer and left him a message on his mobile to call me. At 5pm he hadn't called and there was only an hour left of his shift to carry out a 3 hour job. It wasn't going to happen. I called again, and the agent spent 30 mins trying to get through to despatch without any luck. The parts department had gone home at 5pm, so there was nothing further he could do. He insisted he would call both parts and despatch departments at 9am the following day to find out what had happened and why an engineer for the 5th time in a row had failed to turn up. The saga continues. CEO of British Gas, Mark Hodges, really needs to read this so he knows what a shambles this particular part of the business he runs really is! As of 6pm on the 9th November, the saga continues!

1,"            What an utter shambles. British Gas claimed to have read my meter (not estimated, actually read) in July at 51,000 KWH, and then wrote to me stating that I had been underpaying and would change my direct debit from £65 a month to £165. I trusted they had done this and I had been under paying. In October when I changed my provider to E-ON I read the meter myself and it was at 45,000KWH (this some 3 months later). I had been overcharged by British Gas for my Electricity by around £600. I tried to manually enter my meter reading on the British website, but the option to enter the electricity had been removed. So I rang them and told them the exact meter reading, and the chap was very sorry and promised they would resolve this, and get me an accurate final bill within 20 days. I would be refunded the £600 they have taken from me in error.I trusted they would do this, but to my horror on 23rd October I have received a final bill, inaccurate again, ignoring my meter readings to them and E-ON and estimating it at an even higher number of 54,000 KWH. Now they are going to take another £405 in a second error. I have rung them immediately, to be told they cannot stop the direct debit, and will open an investigation, which could take up to 20th December, and when on the 20th December would I like a call back? That is around 7 weeks from now, and I reported the error to them 3 weeks ago... It is utterly disgusting that you trust these guys with a direct debit on your bank account, and they ignore you meter readings, and clear out your money, all because of their 'errors'.Reading in the news it seems a common error from them. I will be leaving them bad reviews everywhere I can, complaining to Ofgem, and have also emailed the Mirror newspaper who have run a story about this very common error. It seems so common, I can't help think something intentional is going on.Why should they have an interest free loan of £1000 from me for months? They could sort this out within an hour.

Spoke to team leader who said I had been rude to his operator saying that I had said’You are a Call Centre Operator with very few qualifications I would think£ The reply was I have eleven A levels and studying for a degree. I did react by doubting the number of A levels. However I still could not get an answer from the Centre leader in relation to Vunerability. I have been with BG for many years with dual fuels.

In the end had to call out another firm to come and fix the problem- seen same day (British gas couldn't attend until the day after the caller request), fixed same day. British gas a total waste of money. Have reported them to gas Safe register for putting a warning notice on a boiler for a made up electrical wiring problem. Look elsewhere for boiler/heating cover as British Gas all too happy to leave you in the cold.

1,"            I have had a service contract with British Gas for years - both here in Leicester and in my home in Bristol. In the past, on the rare occasions when I had to call them out, they were very prompt. I have the Homecare 400 and Kitchen Appliance cover on my account.However, when my oven broke down today first they claimed it wasn't covered (despite it showing on my account), and that ""Freestanding"" meant ""Freezer"". Eventually, the operator agreed to send someone out, and offered me an appointment in 6 days time!The reason I have an breakdown contract with them is to get a speedy response if there's an emergency. Advertising that I can call them ""any time day or night"" is fine, but rather pointless if that call results in being told I'll have to wait 6 days for a problem to be fixed.

1,"            I am a British Gas Services customer for many years and reason I thought to share my views with public at large is al the noise about Digital, Automation, Robots killing jobs etc. None of this will affect British Gas. When I use my online account to book an engineer visit, I am given a date 30-35 days in advance which is ridiculous for the amount of money I pay each month to look after emergencies in my home. Then you call them and tell that you are not happy with the service and can not for 35 days, an engineer is made available for you in 2 days. What a difference a call makes? Essentially the planning to make the call centres work and human touch continues. This has happened twice in a row so worth sharing. So no point in investing big money in technologies for British Gas and carry on with old traditional ways of working.

Viewing the British Gas website I noted that as a new customer I could get the same HomeCare Two cover for an annual price of £240.00 (and that wasn’t with any NHS employee discount).  So armed with this information I contacted British Gas with the intention of cancelling my current annual agreement and take out the new HomeCare Two policy, only to be told I couldn’t do this as I had to be anon British Gas customer for a period of 3 months.Clearly British Gas has no interest in customer loyalty and is more interested in ripping off existing customers at every opportunity.

EXCEPT IT DOESN’T!The first service is done when they install it- not after you’ve used it. You still need to pay another £78 to get it serviced. My car isn’t serviced when they sell it to me, they do that after I’ve driven it.

At 1230, an engineer arrived and told me it needed a replacement wireless thermostat transmitter that fitted on my living room wall and a receiver that fitted on the boiler. He had the boiler part but not the thermostat so he called another engineer who said he would be round shortly with a spare part.While he was waiting, he checked our records and found that our boiler was nearly due a service which he did while he was waiting. The other engineer then arrived with the part and it was fitted in about 5 mins, tested and worked fine.From booking the call to having the fault fixed. 3 and a half hours. well done British Gas, a great job well done, well worth the money for the service contract.

I was very specific when I made the booking that it was an LPG boiler as I am fully aware they need specifically qualified engineers to service them.When the engineer arrived it quickly became apparent that not only was he not signed off to work on LPG boilers he also did not even have a Hive set with him to install and thought he was there to check an existing Hive system.Then phoned up BG to arrange a new date only to be informed that despite the error being wholly BG fault the earliest they could come back would be 13th December., not good enough, not even close to good enough. I then requested the whole thing to be cancelled and a full refund to be provided and was promised a call back within 48hrs but this did not happen.Then lodged a formal complaint online (which is a painstakingly slow process) & took ages to complete the section asking for a full description of the complaint,.. had a callback fairly quickly to be fair but the BG operators first words were to ask what was the complaint about,. when I told her to reference the online complaint she said she hadn't read it,. when pushed further she said she didn't have access to see the complaint,. Sorry BG but this is a monumentally epic fail on all fronts., how can you trust this kind of company with something so potentially dangerous as gas!?Edit Update: Now have a refund,... by cheque,.. in the post! A cheque you say., in the post you say,.. that I will have to drive into the town centre & take even more time out of my life to pay this into the bank & then wait even longer before I actually have my cash back.,   Why thank you BG for taking my money instantly through modern technology weeks before you were due to even carry out any work & then send me this piece of paper from last century that means you can keep my money in your account for a few more weeks,.

On 16/10/17 they came to service my boiler under a Home Care agreement.  They found that the casing seal had perished and the could not obtain a direct replacement.  They refused to obtain a universal casing seal, disconnected my gas supply and left me without any heating at the start of the Scottish winter.  They then cancelled my Home Care agreement and left me on my own to sort it out.  When I made a complaint they immediately closed it.

The agent I spoke to in order to get the boiler repair and policy in place sounded like she couldn't be bothered to be at work, and wasn't helpful at all.  The alarm bells should have been ringing at this point...2. The engineer turned up at my property that I let out to tenants - I was not there.  The engineer claimed that he couldn't find the fused spur for the boiler to isolate the power  -- THIS IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE -- as the spur was right in front of his eyes as he opened the cupboard door, with a red light illuminating from the spur to show that it is on.  Further to that, the boiler is on a separate ring on the mains connected to the MCB (circuit board).  So all he needed to do if he couldn't see the spur in the cupboard, was flick the fuse switch off in the fuse box.  I must also point out that the airing cupboard that the boiler sits in was empty of towels, blankets etc.3. Because the so called 'engineer' could not isolate the electric to the boiler, he didn't look at the boiler.  Instead, he gave my tenant a load of attitude infront of her children about the repair, and drove off.4.  No contact from British Gas after this.  It was only when I called the tenant to ask how the repair went the next day, did I find out about all this.  Appalling.5.  Called the call centre to ask what the hell is going on.  Only to be told by yet another unenthusiastic call centre operative that she just deals with the whats on the screen and can't help any further.

They are very variable. If you get a good engineer they are great. Having just purchased Hive (with cameras) and been promised that it would be Installed and covered by BG. BG have been woeful. First, they confused me with a previous occupier of a property and still are. Someone needs to read-up on GDPR because if they keep writing to the wrong person about my orders I will as a data registrar if they think personal data is safe with BG. The cover for the boiler, 3 attempts to service a boiler and it still isn’t right. But I am not paying extra from BG to keep being messed about. The cover is fine if the system has a catastrophic failure. Hive, is as reliable as the weather. When it works it is great. The engineer knew nothing about camera so couldn’t/wouldn’t  install   but as it simple I did. The camera is great when it works, alerts ideal for peace of mind. Security, probably not. Even a half-wit thief could potentially evade. Hive, not thought this through. The apps are appalling. Not integrated so two required, one for Hive heating and one for camera (bonkers) then they don’t work on Amazon Kindle (heating does sometimes, Camera doesn’t) Then Hive is down now and then and of course if you are away and want to check on the house…. Save your money. Get Hive alternatives and get them from someone other than BG.

Although it would have been cheaper to have it installed by an independent installer I went with British Gas.  Recently when the boiler broke down Borsch informed me that if I had gone with the independent installer there would have been a 5 year warranty on the breakdown but because I went with British Gas they only have a one year warranty.  When the Borsch repairs man came he issued a Gas Installation Inspection report and which states that there is no visible PE3 at the gas metre and advised on earth bonding and that the installation is not to current standards (NCS). I contacted British Gas by email twice and received no response to my questions.  I also 'chatted' and spoke by telephone.

1,"            For reasons unrelated to British Gas, I decided to switch gas provider (to Ebico), and was amazed by how unhelpful BG was on this. First, they sent me (probably as a punishment) a super highly overestimated final bill. Seriously. My bill was average below £10, and they sent me one for approx. £300. Entirely non-sense. I gave them my actual meter readings, but they did not changed my bill. They said they raised a price dispute with my new supplier, which the latter could not acknowledge. The same bill came again. As I refused to pay, they send me to BPO. As I insisted on the price dispute, they said they raised another. At some point, the person asked me which was my new supplier, and I said Ebico (which is a non-profit one), and the person blamed them for the problem (suggesting they were inefficient), clearly unhappy that I have moved to a non-profit company.Ultimately, I managed to make BG stop my BPO change (which saved me of spoiling my credit history). The person in the phone decided to solve the problem by simply replacing manually the overestimated meter reading with the one I had provided them months before. Why did they do not do this before? Who knows. I think I was just being punished for leaving. In they end, they charged me an extra £25 pounds for admin costs related to the BPO services, which was not my fault. I decided to pay the bill (including the fine) and simply avoid further problems. So, in the end, they got away with it, stealing £25 from me.

1,"            British Gas installed my dual energy smart meter in 2016. In Nov 2016 the in home display failed to connect to the hub and I had (dual fuel) display data so I cannot save energy by allowing me to address unnecessary energy use.  This has persisted to this day.After two ineffective attempts to fix the problem, BG did nothing more. An attempt to use the Ombudsman (who suggested that BG pay me some damages but need not bother to fix the problem) proved unhelpful. I refused that solution because it did not include a remedy, BG has 5m smart meters installed and I have a right to expect that my installation works correctly or is removed or reinstalled. NOTE: Speaking to the Ombudsman puts you on a blacklist at BG and they refuse callouts thereafter. They have confirmed that they will not now fix my In Home Display.  OFGEN next port of call?I consider the behaviour of British Gas on this matter is totally unacceptable (in breach of several agreements) and I believe that their smart meter roll out should now be stopped. There seem to be software problems which this issue conclusively illustrates which call the whole programme into question.As I write this, 11 months later BG's Zigbee-based in home display is still not connected and I still have no display.  My 20 or 30 calls to BG on the matter have resulted in being on an (illegal?)  customer services blacklist. I refuse to give up and am waiting for them to fix the problem, explain why it has not been fixed for a year and offer an apology and compensation.  BG are a dreadful company - I suggest no-one accepts BG smart meters or you may be treated thus way. This case needs to be looked at very carefully in terms of what an energy customer can expect from an energy supplier such as BG and what has happened in what is a very ill-conceived smart meters rollout. This all needs to be brought out into the open and others who are in this situation should also come forward.In response to Jaimie from BG. The Ombudsman did not propose any remedy so his offer was not acceptable. What other routes am I free to follow? Clearly you assume (incorrectly) that they do not include BG. That makes it a blacklist situation. BG blacklists those who seek a solution from the Ombudsman? Interesting.

I am furious at the level of incompetence. Whatever you do never over pay these good for nothing organisations! They have no systems - their right hand does not know what the left one is doing. I've now contacted the ombudsman! Terrible service! Worst ever!!!

2,"            20/10/2017: FOLLOWING BELOW RESPONSE FROM BRITISH GAS THOUGHT I'D GIVE A FINAL UPDATE:In total this simple job has taken 5 visits and was finally finished (fingers crossed) yesterday. Because of the amount of time off work myself and my husband have had to take BG offered me a goodwill gesture which I accepted. However the engineers did leave on 2 occasions saying it was fixed only for me to find it was still leaking and the sink outlet drain pipe was split by an engineer and I had to call them back out. Not one of the 5 engineers took their muddy boots off or wore boot covers like they used to trailing mud through my house. I also checked online yesterday and the white pvc washing machine drain pipes are covered under my homecare cover (only washing machine drain hose isn't which I wouldn't expect) making the dismissive attitude of the first engineer even worse. Also on yesterdays visit I had to put the black, plastic drain cover back together as the engineer had just left it sitting loose and not connected. The sink pipes may finally have been repaired but washing machine drain pipes haven't been. By now I've had enough, my renewal is due end of November and I shall be cancelling and taking cover out elsewhere. The customer service rep, Julie, who dealt with my complaint  was helpful and did all she could, but ultimately it comes down to the work and checks carried out by the engineers. This job should have taken a maximum of 2 appointments, if I'd paid a plumber it would have taken just 1.I still need to get the washing machine drain pipes checked as well but haven't got the time to wait in several times for BG and will get a local plumber to sort. 14/10/17: UPDATE FOLLOWING BELOW REVIEW YESTERDAY  - Noticed yesterday evening when I put everything back under the sink that following the mornings visit the sink now has a leak. Whether this is because of work carried out or another issue I'm not sure but they obviously didn't check all pipes and connections. Tried tightening incase they hadn't done the connections up properly but it's made no difference so a 3rd appointment has been made for tomorrow. A simple job to check under the kitchen sink has now taken 3 visits! Fingers crossed I'm 3rd time lucky but I dread to think how they would cope with an emergency. We've got homecare 300 and when there was a smell coming from the pipes under the kitchen sink and a problem with our toilet not always filling properly I phoned them and they booked a plumber to come and look. I was told on the phone that if the sink issue needed a drains engineer that the plumber would let me know and book this for me. The plumber came out and was polite, I have no issues with him in that respect, however he spent 30 seconds looking under the sink and said it was coming from the washing machine trap (which we're not covered for.)  I was surprised as there's no smell coming from the machine and he didn't take the pipes apart and look but I presumed he must know. He was able to repair the toilet ok. I checked the kitchen sink u-bend and it needed cleaning out which I did, the pipe it went into also did though which I wasn't able to do myself.  We also got someone to look at the machine and there's nothing wrong with it so I booked another appointment for the sink, this time online and they sent a dyno rod drains plumber. He knew straight away what the problem was and flushed and cleared the pipes. I'm annoyed that the first plumber just dismissed the issue without checking properly. If he wasn't able to fix it himself and it's a job for the drains engineer then he should have told me or his office. Instead I've ended up cleaning the u-bend, getting someone to check the machine and then weeks after the first visit finally getting the problem resolved.The gas engineers are always good and get the job done but I find the plumbers British Gas send hit and miss (although always polite). I've also put in a complaint about the first visit via Twitter and I'm waiting to hear back.I've booked another of their engineers to look at a faulty radiator next Thursday, hopefully they'll send one of their own gas engineers and this will go better,  if not I'll cancel my boiler and plumbing cover and I've just left BG for dual fuel as Eon were a lot cheaper. It's a shame as their homecare used to be so good but now they seem to want to do as little (or nothing) as possible when called out. It would be easier to add the emergency cover to my home insurance, put the money I pay BG in our savings account every month and then use it towards any plumbing or boiler repairs we need.

They asked 100 question about everything, and made me hold the line several times. Eventually they said theyll send someone on the same day between 9-6. They also asked for my bank details saying they wont charge me until it gets fixed. I spent my whole day inside waiting for them, didnt leave the house for a second. They didnt show up, and didnt even bother to call me they are not able to show up. I am not able to take a shower at home at the moment. Next day Sunday I called them again and asked why they didnt come, they said they were here but couldnt access. Now this is a huge lie, as I was at home all day and I also have a doorbell and phone number, so they could have easily reach me. Never mind, they said the earliest they can come is Tuesday, so I arrange at my work to have half day off cause they only have two time slots either morning or afternoon. So i was at home today all afternoon waiting for these people, and they did exactlry the same, didnt show up. I am still not able to take a shower and they even took my bank details for nothing, I am extremly disappointed  by this unreliable company and I would suggest evryone to avoid them!!!

Quite dangerous as we are pensioners and do have to get up in the night.I rang them 7.30am Monday (today) only to be told that the earliest anyone would be able to call is Thursday!!!!!I explained that was not good enough and asked if I arranged for an electrician would they pay the bill? The answer was NO!!!!!!!!I was expected to use candles for the next 4 days no matter how dangerous it could have been.I told them I was disgusted and not happy and to cancel my contract and had to wait 20 minutes to be transferred. After explaining the problem I was offered £20 compensation I said not good enough and was then offered £30.00 which I refused and told them to go ahead and cancell contract.Would I recommend British Gas - No!!!!!!Paying £466.78 per year for 24/7 cover which is non existant people should be made aware about their attitude on Customer Service.They can't wait to take your money but do not employ enough staff to carry out their side of agreement.However I managed to get Electrician to come out the same day.

1,"            I bought a boiler from British Gas which has never worked properly for over 5 years. The engineers are clueless about the make and model and never sort out the problems we have with it. Homecare have decided to increase my yearly payment by £70 based on the amount of callouts I have to make. Today I waited in for over 6 hours and they never came. They telephoned at 7.54am and allowed me 7 seconds to answer it which I failed to do. I sat in the front room by the front door with the curtains open from 7.50am until 12.30pm. When no engineer came I called customer services to ask why and they said an engineer had called and put a card through the door. Utter lies as my neighbours CCTV footage proves. Shoddy, untrained and very unprofessional 'service.'

1,"            ....................I would! I posted a review recently, but just when I thought British Gas couldn't get any worse, they have! I have a Home Care Four contract with British Gas (the most expensive they offer) and booked an annual boiler service and gas safety certificate for a rental property. I was given a time slot of 12pm-6pm for the appointment, but on the day, the engineer contacted the tenant at 6.30pm to say he wasn't coming due to bad traffic and that the appointment would need to be re-booked (by me). After holding on phone for over 30 minutes to book an appointment, I gave up and re-booked the appointment online (earliest available was 2 weeks later). It was at this point that I posted my first review. British Gas replied to my review saying ""really sorry, contact us on this email address and we will get it sorted for you, etc, etc"". Sent an email, got an automated response saying I will be contacted within 48 hours, but I’m still waiting……..(that was almost 1 week ago). I contacted the tenant the day after the new appointment date to check it all went OK and was told British Gas did not turn up or contact the tenant! That’s 2 failed appointments and still no contact from British Gas, but hey, with £1.4bn profits, they obviously don’t need my £250 per year!

Wed the boiler went off again no hot water or heating second time this week. Was worried as pressure on boiler was up high. Thursday 5.30 no engineer, called them for advosorvto call engineer  to be told the engineer has not got equipment on him to fix it. Had my grandchildren 2 4 and 6 to be told by Eva on phone there not a priority as over 9 months old. After heated discussion got manager jack on phone said couldn't get anyone out till Friday. I threatened to go public for him to say engineer will be out this evening to try and fix it and bring heaters in case not.

1,"            Do yourself a favour and stay away from this company. I can honestly say that in the whole of my life I have never known such bad service. 25th September I had two engineers booked from British gas - an electrician and a plumber. The contracted Dyno Rod plumber came early in the day, but was unable to complete the job. At around 4:30pm I had a call from British Gas telling me that the electrician had been held up on another job and wouldn’t be able to make it. I was given another appointment for 2nd October, and I also arranged for the Dyno Rod plumber to come back on that day. Unfortunately, things went from bad to worse. NEITHER of the engineers turned up on that following Monday, because they hadn’t been booked properly. These appointments were booked separately. One was booked directly through Dyno Rod, and the other through British Gas. How could they both not be booked properly? It wasn’t until about 5;30pm that I made calls and found this out, so I had been waiting all day. I feel the need to mention also, that when I originally made these appointments, they booked them for the wrong address. The property in question is a rental flat in Brighton, but they were booked for the address where I live with my dad in London. I only realised this when we got an appointment reminder from British Gas on our house phone. Unbelievably, the last time I used British Gas earlier this year, exactly the same thing happened. There was a problem with my heating and they didn’t turn up for appointments multiple times. I was letting my flat on a short term basis at the time, and the people had a small baby. It was a complete nightmare and I ended up having to compensate my guests for the inconvenience. This whole thing has created a really embarrassing situation with my current tenants as well. I feel like a complete idiot having to explain all this to them. And not to mention all the time and money I have spent travelling between London and Brighton every time this happens (British Gas did say they would pay for my train ticket for the 25th September as a goodwill gesture. I asked them to do the same for the following week which I hope they did, but that is a very very tiny thing). I have the appointments booked again for the coming Monday…not holding out too much hope. Will definitely be leaving British Gas soon.

Today Thursday 5th October 2017 at 12 noon someone called Charles number 209803 at the call centre tells me that due to electrical issues they had to prioritise and the next available date is next Tuesday.You can image my mum and me are very upset and frustrated at this point.Charles has no authority so he is just giving me generic answers for when you can't answer.I asked to speak to a Manager called Nicola who called me back 10 minutes within the hour timeframe who I informed my mum is visually impaired and my dad had a stroke.Nicola then said she will call me back in 10 mins.When Nicola called back she said they have an appointment for Friday between 13.00 and 18.00.Great!!

Imagine the stress, not to mention the massive inconvenience, of losing almost £500 from your bank account overnight. After hours of panicked investigation I managed to figure out they’d taken a totally, inconceivably incorrect meter reading and started charging me at a new, ridiculous rate. Here’s what happened next:- They don’t offer phone support on Sundays so I had to figure out this entire mess over canned responses in live chat. Ridiculous.- I called on Monday morning feeling totally unassured. The person I spoke was so rude and essentially explained it was my fault for not seeing an email alerting me of the price change.- There was no email.- They refused to even apologise and showed no empathy for the fact they’d mistakenly taken a life altering amount of money out of my account.- I demanded to speak to a manager and was promised a call back the same day. It never came.So here I am, still waiting for my call, still waiting for my refund and ready to switch providers as soon as I sort out this living nightmare.

My tariff shows: GAS Homecare Free Sunday Mar 2018 AND ELECTRICITY Homecare Free Sunday Mar 2018. Only to find out on 28th She 2017 that its only ELECTRICITY that is free.  THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND A CLEAR CHEATING OF CUSTOMERS WHICH IS AGAINST THE CONSUMER ACTS OF 2008 AND 2015.  I questioned them and their reply is its in the terms and conditions.  My argument is that during the marketing period, it was clearly sold to me as free gas and electricity.  I trust the company as I am with British Gas for more than 5yrs.  Clearly a strategic promotions to mislead the consumers.  Why sell ""bacon and egg"" when you only give ""egg""?  Just sell egg when you can only give egg.  So frustrating, not much of the value of money but how I am treated by my so long trusted company. I bought my combi-boiler with British Gas including a homecare cover because I have a high regard in this company.  NOW, I CANT WAIT TO FINISH MY CONTRACT TO MOVE OUT.

Basically the stop cock didn't not do its job.  This has happened in the past an engineer visits and sorts it.  This engineer did not turn up at my house to do a flaming thing,  I unfortunately discussed making possible changes to the system to prevent this problem from reoccurring.  Well I think this was a reason for him to not even look at fixing the problem like his colleagues had done in the past.  He said I needed Dynorod who were now part of BG.  Although I am on gas care 400 I was asked for a £50 excess.  I paid it initially because I just wanted the problem sorted.  When the engineer left I called and cancelled the Dynorod call out and proceeded to call BG to get my excess refunded. Spoke to Jordan, useless you could hear his frustration with me over the phone, totally unprofessional.  I asked to cancel my care package and he put me through to customer care.  Why call it that BG when no customer care was provided at all.  Sophie asked whether there was anything she could do to change my mind but instead what she did with her lack of companion was to force me to also find another gas provider at the end of my contract at the end of the month.  All I wanted someone to explain to me was why a repair that had been done last year which didn't cost me no more than the monthly payments now cost £50.  It's a disgraceful was to treat s loyal customer of over 20 years.  I will be advising everyone that I know to move away from BG there hardly the cheapest and now they can add rude, u professional rip off merchants to their poor customer service.This is the second time I have contact BG in as many months and can honestly say that both occasions have left me furious with the poor level of customer service.

Initially, we were pleased to find that our new house developers ( Linden Homes) has signed everybody on a new estate with British Gas. Little did we know that our entire experience with British Gas ( As a new Customers) will be utterly dissapointing and extremely unpleasant. I have been calling British Gas for the past week now. All i wanted is to introduce ourselves and finally see what tariff are we on. We have got 9 month baby, so every single penny counts. Well, the first agent was not even interested! He said: “ i cannot give you any prices, i suggest you go online and look for the options."" Well, i thought perhaps that agent had a miserable personality anyway, so i thought i'd give another call as i would rather stick to the current supplier. Second agent i spoke to yet again was not helpful at all. Well today i called them twice, spent my entire lunch break of 45 min being on hold and when i finally got through to somebody the agent was utterly useless! He asked to repeat our postcode at least 4 times, write it down for goodness sake! I called them again after work, the lady on a phone, i wish i had written her name down to let others know how useless British Gas customer service agents are! Anyway, she sounded miserable and unhappy, now this was the 4th person i spoke to that had zero customer service skills. Anyways, i had a crying baby in my hands and kindly asked her to help me, i desperately needed to know the tariff we are on, what is going to be monthly costs and only then i will decide wether to go with BG or go elsewhere. She drugged and drugged the entire process, so after 15 - 20 min on a phone i finally got the pricing of £106 a month, when i can apply directly from BG website and the cost is £98. Outcome of it now is that i definitely WILL NOT be a new BG customer. Scottish Powers offer £65 a month, E-on offer £59 , why would i want to pay £106 with atrocious customer services on a top.. NO thank you very much! And i will make sure to go around all our new neighbours that  still in the process of moving in and share what an utterly unpleased, unprofessional, disgusting experience with British Gas i had. Ah and of course i will let our house developers know too… Perhaps they will cancel all the arrangements with British Gas too, that would cheer up BG management and perhaps only then they will invest a little bit more on their current customer service representation.

They offered us a free boiler service/check (07.08.17) for piece of mind which I was keen to have done as the boiler is in the cupboard in my baby's room.The Engineer (Lee, Employee No. 123815) told us that it is in good working order and there's nothing that needs attention. I was pleased.Last week the hot water stopped working so we called out an engineer direct from the boiler manufacturer. He diagnosed the fault but cannot fix the fault because the boiler should not be used. He has stuck a warning label on the boiler and said under no circumstances do you switch it on.The reason is that the flue has no collar and is sealed with gaffer tape which can leak carbon monoxide putting my child at serious risk.I have contacted British Gas customer services twice, and twice been cut off with no callback. Nearly 1 hour on the phone with no response to the situation.I will be taking this matter down the legal route as a representative of British Gas has endangered the life of a child by signing off a boiler that is clearly not fit for use.I'm utterly disgusted and stunned at the situation.

1,"            We moved into a new property and British gas charged us alot more than the meter reading read. So they threatened us with legal action if we did not pay. The customer service lady said saying we had cancelled the complaint when we had not and told us you have to pay the amount. Not very nice phone call for anyone to experience.  Will keep well clear of BRITISH GAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1,"            Had smart meters installed by BG in August 2016. Since then it has been a complete shambles - I couldnt see the meter readings on their website nor could I access the promised smart energy features nor could I manage my DD payments online. I raised several complaints but in over a year they were unable to fix the problems. I wasted a huge amount of time speaking to various technical teams who frankly seemed like they did not have a good grasp of BG systems. Ive just switched to Bulb and they are much easier to deal with ( and a lot cheaper since the BG price hike). Im still waiting for the BG final bill - I've had two incorrect or incomplete bills in the last week. Needless to say I will not be settling the balance outstanding until they get a correct bill to me based on the confirmed final meter readings.

I asked him to give me the details of the parts he would need as I would source them myself. All of a sudden they can get all bar one part and  probably get the other. If I wanted. A visit from a salesman I would have asked. Wouldn't buy a thing from Scottish Gas even if I need a new system which I don't it wouldn't be from them. Engineer called Willie working in and around Fife, watch out for him.UPDATE - JUST READ THE REPLY FROM BRITISH GAS WHICH IS LAUGHABLE, DIFFERENT ENGINEER ARRIVED TODAY AND THE BOILER HAS BEEN FIXED....ITS A MIRICLE OR MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS ARE CONFIRMED YOU DECIDE.........

Online it is currently £16.43 with 1 month free.Over the phone it was £18 for 12 months and they are refunding me £18 .£2 more expensive and more hassle.What was a good day turned into to tense conversation for no reason.Called in the evening and spoke with another rude and charged up agent called Scott to check that the details were set up as I hadn't received any confirmation email as discussed with the agent in the morning .Scotty too Hotty told me that there is no error with signing up on line and then proceeded to go from 0 to 100 and pipe up.My time was wasted speaking to agents with foul attitudes . and my good mood tested.British Gas need to be mindful of the agents that are representing them because I have received a short fall in simple customer service. 1 month apparently free, is not enough for the service I have received. My first bad review and it is British Gas.May raise with the complaints team !

When the electrician arrived, he told us that he didn't know what he was sent for and that he couldn't do anything about the washing machine or the shower. He did, however, clear a blockage from the dishwasher. This is where it got worse. We came back downstairs to discover he had used one of our CLEAN tea towels to remove the fat- which was left sitting in our sink!! When we tried to call him back, he simply did not pick up- despite the fact we could still see him sat at the end of the road. I am in shock at this disgraceful service.

1,"            I have been with British Gas for more than 40 years and till just over two years ago they were ok. However over the last two years or so we have been treated with utter contempt.1. When our old gas meter was removed so we could have a smart meter installed (their wish, not particularly ours) a proper reading was not taken which led to us having to accept an estimated reading.2. When our smart meter was installed that took 2 visits by three persons.3. When the smart meter failed in July this year an engineer came. He said there would have to be a further visit.4. On the second visit we were told the wrong hud had been fitted and there would have to be another visit which was scheduled shortly before we move house. When I complained about all the matters set out in this mail I was told there was no need to have the smart meter sorted and the appointment was cancelled.5. When we move we will have to submit a final reading as  the smart meter will still not be working. The website gives no clue as to how we might do this given that they have us as being on a smart meter. When I spoke to the complaints person she said that we could use our account page despite the fact that the incorrect information about submissions was part of the complaint. On checking online and asking to submit a reading I am told we have a meter!6. We appear to be hugely in credit and required some assurance that a prompt refund will be given when we vacate. Have been given the assurances but in view of the below don't quite trust them... Do we intend to use British Gas when we move, certainly not!7. Some two years ago despite promptings they failed for some reason best known to them to take direct debits for gas leaving us considerably in debit. Foolishly we thought they had acted on our prompt, whereupon they demanded payment by a specific date. Though time for payment was later extended the whole situation was entirely unsatisfactory. We were treated as though the debt situation were our fault.8. They persisted in a very annoying habit (despite being corrected) of addressing me 'Dear Mrs x' my correct name but addressing correspondence to me as Mrs Y (a previous name). an engineer who called last week thought he had an appointment with Mrs Y.9. Many of the complaints were marked as settled but in view of the history I asked that the complaints were looked at as part of a bigger picture in view of wasted time When I was telephoned (I had asked to be texted or e mailed as I am extremely busy) to say I was treated with utter contempt is an understatement. I was read to from what was clearly a prepared script and it quickly became clear that there was no question of recompense being offered for the time wasted when I should have been working.I was told they were sorry we were leaving them and they pride themselves on customer care. No real apology for the errors. the person spoken to hoped I would have a nice day!Utter rubbish. The company we are going with when we move has poor reviews but are much cheaper. They are doing well so far and can't be worse than BG. Oh and they don't yet do smart meters.

They then told me they can transfer me to a better tariff i told them not to bother as i was leaving them which i did. They then wrote to me and informed me i would get a final bill after my gas was taken over they sent me a bill it was a further 13 days before my new supplier took over my electricity i then got a bill from British Gas for £79.13 this was for 13 days use of electricity. I have refused to pay this in the 13 days they scammed me for i was home for 3 days every item apart from my fridge was off so i really would like to know where they got this figure from.

Just rubbish, bad prices, bad customer service , a Managing Director who earns a fortune and I quote the Guardian:""The boss of British Gas’s parent company was handed a pay increase of nearly 40% last year, a raise Labour attacked as “astronomical” and a “kick in the teeth” for millions of families living in fuel poverty.Centrica chief executive Iain Conn’s remuneration jumped from £3.02m in 2015 to £4.15m in 2016, enough to pay the heating and lighting bills for nearly 4,000 customers on the company’s standard tariff.""Just give these bums the heave- ho.

3,"            This is a bit of a mixed review.  We have been quite happy during the year we have been with British Gas apart from a couple of things like having to wait around 15 minutes to speak to someone sometimes!  We were on a collective switch which was a very good price but this is now coming to an end and this is where I feel really frustrated.  If we just do nothing we are automatically switched to their standard tariff which means we will pay hundreds of pounds more next year to use the same amount of energy.  Hence me having to spend weeks reading reviews of other companies and comparing prices!  Its really important that any switch I do is easy and that the company is efficient and deals quickly with any problems.  After extensive research I have decided to go with Bulb, who consistently seem to get excellent reviews and offer affordable green energy.Their prices are not fixed, so could go up or down, but understand they have reduced them recently when others were going up!  They also only have one tariff so no more spending time searching for an alternative supplier when your fixed deal finishes and no more being put on a ridiculous tariff!  Hoorah!Really like the friendliness of these guys and the fact that you can ask questions online and that someone actually responds to you! Also they were around 10% cheaper than the other company I was considering and after reading literally hundreds of reviews on various companies, people certainly seem happy with them, which cannot be said about many of their competitors!The best bits for me were that you are you are not tied into a contract, so if things change you can get out penalty free. They are also currently paying any exit fees you may have from other companies. Other things I like are that everything is done over the internet/phone. You pay by automated debit card payment so no need to set up direct debit. When you do your quote online at their website  if you have the exact cost of energy used or amount used, just press the refine button and it does you a more personal quote than just the amount of bedrooms you have! Knocked around £200 off my bill straight away! Installed the app on my phone and access to my account was easy as they send an email link, so you don’t have to remember your password. I like their website, quite modern and once you access your account it is laid out in a really easy to understand way.Things you may wish to consider – prices are not fixed, so could go up or down. However I understand they reduced prices recently and they are already around 10% less than the other company I was considering so I have some leaway. Their office is not currently open at weekends, but plenty of other time/ways to get in touch if need be.Of course the refer a friend incentive that they are currently offering is a great idea and I just picked a link from a person who had done an informative review. It was so simple, just took you to the website page for a quote. The person doesn’t get any of your personal information just a notification from Bulb that you’ve used their link. This way we both get a credit of £50 once the switch is completed which is an added bonus. Apparently you can refer as many people as you like, so could work out very well! However, don’t sign up through comparison sites as you won’t get this benefit. Once you’ve filled in your details you immediately get an email from Bulb, with a timescale of dates that things will happen and the date you switch will be complete. Also  an attachment with lots of information.Early days yet but really like the ethos of this company and also the fact that you are helping the planet! Hope my review has helped and if you would like to use my link that would be an added bonus! Thank you in advance.bulb.co*.*uk/refer/penny3803 (just remove stars)

2,"            I had a smart meter installed earlier this year and now I wish to switch to another provider because British Gas have increased the dual fuel  price by over £500 per year. I have tried to switch but both alternative suppliers that I've spoken to will not take over the account because the BG smart meter does not work with their system. British Gas did not inform me that having a smart meter would limit my choice, or possibly prevent me from switching at all.I then  asked  BG to remove the smart meter and replace it with an original.  They refused. So at the moment I am stuck with British Gas, unable to switch. If I had known that a smart meter would limit my choice of supplier,  I would not have had one installed. It seems to me that this is a critical piece of information that customers should be made aware of.In my opinion it is a cynical marketing lock-in. I would advise you to avoid British Gas and in particular avoid anything to do with a smart meter.

1,"            AVOID AT ALL COSTSPossibly THE worst customer service I've ever experienced, and they signed me up with all sorts of promises which so far, have not been delivered. I came from EDF Energy only because I wanted Smart Meters. I originally had PAYG meters as these were in the property when we first moved in over 20 years ago - we just worked with what we had, but it's not longer cost effective or convenient. After waiting an incredible 3 MONTHS to get meters installed, the engineer turned up today to fit them. On his way out of the house, I asked where the Smart Meter devices that provide the all essential information were, and he replied ""We are only installing credit meters today"".... EH ????I contacted British Gas, who told me I'd have to wait 28 days before someone could update a simple record on a database (this is 2017, right ??), and then would have to book my smart meter installation - oh, and let's not forget that also means ripping out the meters that have just been installed !I promptly told British Gas to cancel my contract. It's outside of the 14 day cooling off period, but it's been missold - mainly because they declined to tell me about their outrageous price increase at point of sale. I have now booked an installation with OVO, who in comparison are like a breath of fresh air.Do yourself a favour, and don't waste your time or sanity with British Gas. This company is still stuck in the 50's when it comes to customer service, and are far too complacent. The agent I spoke to initially had a ""couldn't give a f..."" attitude even when I asked to speak to her supervisor. Absolutely disgusting.

1,"            I honestly can't put into words the amount of upset and stress this discusting company is causing us. We moved from British Gas about 6 months ago having had nothing but problems with them trying to set up a direct debit. They then tried to tell me someone was trying to get my name and address details but then couldn't tell me anything else. The next person I spoke to then said this wasn't even true! Most of the operators don't speak English well enough to be able to answer questions which causes frustration on both sides. We moved to Sainsburys energy not knowing at the time that they were intact just British Gas under disguise. We explained all the problems we had to the very helpful lady at Sainsburys Energy and she even told us how many people have problems with them and how many customers of theirs end up with Sainsburys. Well she must have been laughing into her lunch knowing fine well that we were changing to exactly the same supplier. Of course when the rules were changed to fix the loophole and stop them mascarding as another company providing cheaper prices under this guise it all comes out and they put our prices up by nearly 200%. We were then told by an externally rude woman that we had been put on the wrong tarrif and it was the problem of uswitch and to just pay it! We cancelled the supply and asked for a breakdown of useage. Uswitch were also really helpful and said that what they are doing is illegal. We asked British Gas to answe a number of questions about the rates but they have so far refused to respond to these request and just fob us off and demand we pay what they say because they say so. We have spoken to people who hang up on us, shout at us, tell us that they do not have to provide proof of bills and threaten us with bailiffs. They have even sent us the wrong contract tired to deny what we have hard evidence of and then sent us out a new one with what they wanted on it! We have spoken to an a supposed manager who odopted an array of tactics to try and avoid the issues. He denies we made calls, denies we ever used the app (we have screen shots) used an email address we no longer use (and told him not to use on at least 3 occasions as it's not regularly monitored) all to try and get the complaint to the time when he can close it down due to 'no response'. They have passed this to at least 4 different debt collection agencies one of which has been very sympathetic and tried to help get the information we wanted. They came back to us saying there is no record of an open company from us as we are just not paying! This is 2 days after they issued their final response letter which we have been asking for months since we are not getting anywhere. Their deadlock letter is totally inaccurate and now to top it all off they have told me that if I do not pay within 28 days then there will be a default logged on my credit file. I have never said I won't pay what I owe but I don't believe the bills are correct and all I want is a breakdown. I amLiterally at my wits end, I will be going to offgem tomorrow to see if they can help as I am so upset and stressed it is unreal. Please everyone for your own sanity stay away from this appalling company. They don't care about their customers one bit, they do what they want and won't listen or respond with information most people would want if they don't think something is correct. Luckily we have emails upon email of contact trying to get answers and hopefully offgem will do something about them. Totally disgraceful conduct I wish I never went near them.

The first complaint is in relation to boiler servicing. I booked a one off service last year (their engineer was incompetent and raised several safety concerns which wasted the time of myself and the builder of my property) and they have charged me for another service this year without discussing this with me. I do not want to use their company for a service; they are not responding to my complaints and will not give me a refund. They have in effect stolen money from me and are refusing to give it back.The other one is in relation to an error on the national database in relation to my postcode - this means that I cannot move my gas supply away from British Gas to other suppliers (I've tried twice before finally working this out). British Gas have not corrected this in months and have in effect trapped me into my deal. It's clearly not in their interest to correct this as I'll move my supply straight away.You would think that a large supplier like British Gas would offer good customer service but you'd be wrong. They are just as bad if not worse than the smaller suppliers.

When we rang and spoke to someone they confirmed we had payed over and that we were now in credit.While speaking to this lady she told me that it would take 3-5 working days for our refund to sent out in a check. 2 weeks later still nothing had arrived... but while on the phone with her we changed our monthly payments she fave a figure but we added 20 on top to cover any extra usage a year later we received a letter stating our monthly payments were increasing by an extra 35 a month they also gave a break down on what we are using we didn't contest this until this week when I had an email about saving over 300 a year. When I checked my account I saw we were in debt again . I put an up to date readings in and again jumped up into more debtI rang and as my wife took over from her dad on the account after he passed my name was put down also on the account but they told me I wasn't after arguing with them for hours on Tuesday. They told me I should be paying another 45 on top of the increase of 35 they explained that we are using over 1000 in electrics and over 1500 in gas but with the letters they send it didn't add up... I spoke to 3 people that day that all gave me a monthly payment amount with in 30 of the least to the most not one was close enough to agree and none of them included any of the debt that was on our account I lodge 4 counts of complaints about the service that day and was told I would receive a call back the following monday my complaints were 1. I was not put on the account after 4 times of getting cleared by the wife (still not on now) 2. They failed to inform us that we over payed. 3. They failed to tell us we weren't paying enough even though they sent a letter out upping our monthly that were apparently still not enough.4. Giving detailed information that what we use per month in gas and electricity. When he filed these complaints he still said we owed them the money.2 days later Thursday morning I receive an email stating our monthly payments weren't changing from what the were changed to in May this year. This is still nothing to what they said we were going to pay.Now I'm really confused as I been told 3 prices not including the debt but am paying 45 less than what they said. When I spoke to this chap again who is dealing with complaints he said british gas have made mistakes. Now shouldn't this be of concern that they have put someone in debt . And still getting it wrong . The next day I receive another email stating what we are using slightly different to May but same payments and then I receive a email stating that were a in debit aswell..Very poor and can't correct their wrong doings disgusting from them. Not only that we were told we could not leave as they would not allow us to as we owe them money. Errrm wrong you broke the contract so as it stated on the system we dnt have a contract from 15th September as they stopped our tariff but we change on the 21st...........

Neighbors changed energy suppliers, somehow that screwed up my account.4. British Gas fixed that by creating another elecricity account for my flat. I now had two accounts, and didn't know that.5. Meter readings were all wrong, and the ones I gave them kept being rejected. Billing was arbitrary.6. Meter reading by meter inspector got rejected as well. Billing completely arbitrary.7. I lost hope of getting this mess fixed, decided to leave.8. Finally my gas meter readings got accepted, got billed correctly for the gas used on final bill.9. Got billed arbitrary (but not excessive) amount for electricity as meter readings were still wrong which I paid just to get out.10. Whoops, the second electricity account that was opened for my property (see 4) wasn't settled. British Gas double billed me and contacted by debt collectors without talking to me first.11. Sorted this with British Gas, they admitted it was a mistake, promised to sort it out.12. Got contacted again by debt collectors, as debt is still oustanding, almost ended up in court.13. Countless hours on the phone, saga still continues... Worst incompetent service I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.

They have now taken legal action because I can't afford to pay the £699. I then spoke to somebody yesterday at British gas she asked to take my meter reading so I then gave it to her. I discovered that the man who read my meter got the numbers completely wrong and I don't actually owe £699 but they still are taking legal action because a warrant has been issued. I do owe money on my account but I would of been able to pay that if the man read my meter properly.

British Gas are happy to take our money, but when it actually comes to repairing appliances the waiting time is ridiculous. On two separate occasions an engineer was booked in and just didn't turn up. We are having to wait nearly a month to have our oven repaired and all we have been offered is £30 compensation!

1,"            British Gas Homecare is a complete rip-off. The moment they will detect a major fault, they will rub their hands off. I was moving into a new house and therefore, bought Homecare four policy to give myself a peace of mind. Got a confirmation letter that my policy has started from 22nd August. After 12 days in my new house a gas leak was noted and I called up British Gas. They were very nice initially, sent their Engineer the same day. Once the Engineer reported that this was a major fault and will require a complete gas pipe re-run in the property, the company changed their stance. They initially told me that this is an old fault so they will not cover. when I argued that this seems likely a new fault as there were no increased gas meter readings for the previous owner and also the meter moved normally during the past 12 days I have been in the property. Therefore, whatever is the fault causing such significant gas leak has occurred on the day I have reported and hence as such I should be covered as my Homecare policy was up and running. This did not make any difference and I was left on my own when I needed them the most. They told me that I am not covered till their Engineer has made his first visit to the property. I argued that in this case British gas should have arranged for this review before confirming that I am covered from 22nd August and should have made sure that the engineer has visited the property on day 1. The faults can develop anytime and that is the reason people pay exorbitant amounts of premium to such companies thinking they will cover them when needed. I felt betrayed and cheated by this company policies! Later I called up local gas engineer through checkatrade.com and was able to hire a fully qualified, very skilled and efficient engineer who came and fixed the whole problem for one-third the price British gas quoted for the job.

3,"            I use British Gas for energy and homecare.  Rejoined them a year ago for energy, I've been a homecare 400 customer for over 10 years.I'd like to believe that British Gas means well, but they have become a 1984-style monolithic machine, so it's impossible to communicate with them.  They simply have NO IDEA what's happening on the ground.Energy is fine, their system works, but felt personally insulted when they announced a 12% price increase, so have initiated a switch to Bulb.  Never had a great experience from their UK call centre, but didn't expect much.  They're offering to fix the price until 2019 - all they're doing is putting all their price increases at once, up front.  Financially that's profitable for them, less good for customers.Homecare has gone off the rails.  I used to trust them, but work recently has been below standard.  Their engineers, for the most part, are friendly, here's a review of some of the mishaps:Boiler - 10 years ago their installation went wrong, new boiler broke after 2 weeks, they tried not to fix it, insulted my wife, until I wrote to a company director - after which it was fixed but I was exhausted by then.  We ended up with a working but bashed up boiler that had been through the wars - it was supposed to be new.  It has always leaked a bit, never shows the water pressure when it's not circulating, but works - the bare minimum.  Wasn't value for money though - they have visited annually to service it and it's working, so that's good.Plumbing cover was adequate - most engineers friendly, sometimes a little terse.  Reported a leaking cistern, engineer came and adjusted the fill level and left.  Drains - told I wasn't insured for broken rainwater drain outside the house - to his credit, engineer did what he could.  Unblocking sink - blocked again next day (and fixed myself).  Cistern leak a year later (we left it a year) repaired properly, but caused huge puddle on the floor the next day where pipe not tightened.  Dishwasher - reached end of life, British Gas paid 30% voucher to replace, but only usable at Currys or Argos.  Currys made a real mess, and still unhappy with replacement dishwasher - installed at wrong height so I (myself!) had to cut the plinth - it's not properly level and they broke the legs so can't be adjusted.  Therefore I won't be using Currys (or Argos) in future, which nullifies the value of any voucher system.Washing machine - wonderful engineer fixed 3 times over 10 years.  Finally end of life because broken door button can no longer be sourced - but ultimately very poor response from them about it, so have decided to go to AO.com to get a replacement, and forget their so-called voucher (limits choice, perhaps costs the same or more than private purchase).  Also, in order to be able to wash clothes in the meantime, I managed to solve opening the door using a piece of wire - would have been good if they could have done something like that themselves.Oven - won't fix.  My contract says 'gas cooker' (not sure why, but they could have messed up when switching IT systems a few years ago) so they refuse to fix my electric oven element.  I have homecare 400 + plumbing + electric + appliances, but they are still being pedantic over something I may or may not have listed when the contract was taken out - and I don't really see what difference it should make one way or the other. It is not possible to complain or discuss problems, all messages I sent on their app were NOT answered at all, let alone within the 2-days promised.  Their engineer spoke to the call centre on my behalf, and call centre gave a new number where the problem could be resolved, so engineer left.  The number was a dud!  Not in service.  This was last week.All in all, for the amount I pay, the service I've received, the additional costs in time and money I've paid for bad work or refusal to fix, I've decided I could insure myself for the same amount and find my own repairers, with the benefit of never going through their call centre, and restoring my freedom of choice.  They actually called my mobile and asked ""can you tell me the number I called?"", without even being able to identify themselves!  I could randomly call a mobile phone and say I'm from British Gas, give me your name, address, post code and phone number please.  Doesn't anyone think that's, like, STUPID?  They won't talk to you if you don't.  So I'm not going to talk to them any more, or pay them any more money.

I called British Gas to ask why and I was told it was because my account was £800 in credit and they were taking payments out of that credit. I told them that wasn't right but they insisted it was and sent me a cheque for the £800. I didn't cash the cheque knowing full well it was a mistake and guess what? It was. Turns out there was no credit and because they stopped taking payments my account was seriously in debt. We came to an agreement that I would make payments back and a price per month was set.Problem is that British gas kept putting my payments up and up to more than I could afford to pay off the debt. I fell behind and they had the cheek to chastise me for missing payments. They told me it would be best to put me on a pay as you go meter. I stupidly agreed thinking they were trying to help. It was a struggle but I paid off my debt, every penny. But i am still sitting here having no gas in my home for almost 2 months because every time I put money in my meter it disappears to ""owed and emergency credit"" I don't use emergency credit as its not offered to me and I paid off my debt so where is my money going?!

3,"            I'm at loggerheads with myself over BG and here's why1, We have never had a problem when calling them out to fix anything although to be fair have been with them for 10 years now and have had them out about 5 times....always quick and efficient with appointments booked really quickly and engineer on site as bookedHowever2, had an engineer out recently to fit our smart meters and he told us that our electric board was illegal despite it only having been fitted last year and us having all the requisite certificates???? Rather odd but then I suppose things change so quickly what was legal last year could be illegal this....funnily enough BG fitted a boiler in our last house and then 1 year later at service time said it didn't match standards?????3, Now the crux......received my homecare renewal through and it had gone up by £65 this year.....did a price comparison online and found the exact same cover for only £20.50 so I rang them to do a bit of bartering.....the chap on the phone said he couldn't do anything but would get someone to ring me back Friday.....lo and behold.....no phone call......so BG I'll just cancel what I have (and have just moved my Gaz and leccy to PFP (12.5% is quite the joke) and retake it out again in a couple of weeks through that comparison site

1,"            I had such a bad experience with this company its shocking . I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and the place used to be the office . British gas had not done a reading there for about 2 years but managed to send us a bill for 4 months for 2500£ !!!!!!!!! Next minute after a complain they changed it and we got a bill for 960!!!!!!!! We asked them to provide us details where do they get these numbers . Its estimate !!!!! We don't run a factory over here my response was . This company is shocking . Couple of months from now on and I got another 4 different numbers !!!!!! 2 weeks back I spoke to a guy on a phone and he asked me for a FINAL BILL for 190£ . I asked !!!! Is this the last final bill ??????? Is this the last number you coming out with ???? He said YES ! This morning I received another one for 585£ !!!!!!!!!!! This company is a mess !!!!!! They are just trying to get your money with some random different numbers every month !! Someone needs to check this company and make sure they are not trying to do this to anyone else.   Phone conversations its another mess !!!! You speak to 20 different people ! No one knows what is actually going on and the best think is mostly they come out with some completely different random numbers and when you ask them where did you get these numbers from they tell you its estimate !!!!!!!!! Estimate for 4 months 2500£??????????????? This company is the worst hassle you will ever have to deal with . Never again BRITISH GAS !!!!!  Wost experience ever !!!!! If I pay the final bill I BET in a couple of weeks there will be another bill coming !!! Another final bill ...... guys don't put yourself through this . The company is a mess and just trying to get out as much money as they can !!!!

Its a shame really but if BG really wanted to keep their loyal long term customers they would be offering better offers for fixed rate tarrifs (I actually would have stayed with BG  if they had) overall not had any major problems with them but who can afford to pay even more for energy now a days... not me so looked into other suppliers and seems bulb will save us £300 a yr and give us £50 credit to start to.

I doubt it very much. 2nd formal complaint raised today after the first complaint where we were awarded compensation resulted in a cheque bouncing and the complimentary Homecare package we are repeatedly assured we have is still not showing on our account over a year and a half later after numerous emails back and forth. Service engineer has failed to turn up today even though I have waited in all day and did not receive a call back after the appointment was confirmed but subsequently cancelled as they couldn't find the Homecare agreement. Shocking British Gas, you need to get your house in order and you only need to read your reviews to see the many unhappy customers! Absolutely disgusted with your service from start to finish and you inform me my complaint may take 28 days to be actioned??? I have never been so disappointed and disillusioned with a company with whom we went with because of your credentials. It is an embarrassment.

1,"            Problem after problem with British Gas. I've complained about a few of the issues but have had apathetic responses, bordering on offensive. Trying to get any kind of resolution has been tiring. It is as if they don't want to retain customers. I've been meaning to switch suppliers for a long while now but received a huge bill from BG (due to their error) and I can't switch until it's ironed out. I'm only a customer of theirs because the previous owners of my house were with them, but given they are about to hike their prices, there isn't a single reason why anyone should choose British Gas. Some of the issues I've had (this is just in one year):- Just told me my DD is changing from £60 per month to £200 despite my usage being £60- Cut off my gas supply after fitting smart meter due to small leak that was within safe limits. Cost me £150 just to have plumber cap the hob supply and now I am without a hob. Plumber told me I BG shouldn't have done this.- Website broken for months, unable to log in, submit readings etc- Website (now can log in) cannot cope with meter readings when they tick over to zero- Called me to take up a ""free boiler service"". Failed to mention that this was actually signing me up to Home Serve- I moved in to my house in August and opened an account with them - it wasn't until November that they actually set up my Gas account. This has caused no end of problems with overestimation of usage

If you are thinking of paying a monthly fee to British gas for homecare, I would think again as your money may get wasted like mine.

When will it stop ?downgraded to 1 star again - if I could get away with no stars, you would have none19/8/17 1356pm - still no response - time to pay the bill again - maybe you would like to escalate this to your CEO Mark Hodges for me.  Oh hang on, you cannot respond to anything I am asking - I have found his e-mail address, off I go to him insteadUPDATE 23/8/17 - It pays to find out who the CEO of a company is.   I have just had a very nice e-mail from Jack Hobson.  My administration fee has been credited to my gas account.   In all fairness, it was only ever about the fact I had not received the original invoice.SO WELL DONE BRITISH GAS, YOU ARE NOW UPGRADED TO 4 STARS (I cannot give you 5 stars, as I had to do all the chasing) !Trustpilot advised me a lot of people found my review useful, so I am happy to have been able to help other people !A VERY MUCH HAPPIER CUSTOMER

It seems that these offers are a pushy way to lock you in to further services.When the engineer eventually came he was excellent, and this is what is frustrating: let the quality of these services sell your additional products BG rather than the hard sell on the phone. Hive is an excellent innovation, and I have to say your engineer's softly softly approach was in contrast to the call centre.Your fuel prices are exhorbitant, but I guess you're not alone there.

3,"            I have to say, although British Gas *in theory* provide a great service, I've found them to be a bit of a let down.Firstly, full disclosure - I've never had to call on them in an emergency and I understand that these situations obviously take priority and I'd imagine a higher and more efficient rate of response, so I'm writing from a general customer perspective.I've been with BG for around two years, I've had boiler cover and i get my gas and electricity vicariously through them via another company.The supply of actual gas and electricity is great, no power cuts, gas is always on, the metering is accurate and the price is fair, so full marks on that front, which is the most important.Customer service, is friendly and responsive (if you phone - do NOT try to get anything resolved over email, it just doesn't work - 9 days and counting to reply to emails while claiming a 72 hour response rate).Reliability for inspection and repair (I.E - boiler cover, gas safety certificates) is not good. I've had several occasions where I've waited in over 4 hours for an appointment only to be told that they've been delayed and now I'll have to wait till the next day to get my appointment. As a remote landlord who has to travel to, or arrange for people to be at a property specifically for these inspections, this is a real let down. To be fair, compensation has been provided on these occasions but the greater loss is in the time and effort spent arranging for the inspection to be carried out.The website, for me, is useless, especially if you have an account under the same email address with BG and also one of their other companies - logins will disappear, passwords will stop working, information will disappear etc. Even once this is resolved, the website can be unresponsive, if not stuck in an infinite loop, it does things like randomly cancel appointments after confirmation but before sending email confirmation. Overall, these, which might seem like minor issues, can end up being a real headache for a landlord, sorting Gas and Electric should be a one or two hour job, once a year, with these guys, it turns into days worth of effort.Overall, I'd like to give them a better rating, but the letdowns are really just too much. If they upped their game on efficiency and reliability for the regular man, it'd be a full 5 stars.

Don't trust anything that an advisor tells you without double checking with another staff member. They have tried everything to get a new customer and keep a new customer and have at every stage ignored that person. Don't trust anything they tell you!!!!

1,"            This company cares for profits not service.Living in the country , we are still slightly off the main gas supply route, some years back the village asked to be connected to the mains and we were told it it would cost over £10,000 per household for connection, realistically the village should have been added years ago as a matter of customer and community care, but it is British Gas , they don't care.We asked if , as they could not provide us with gas and therefore it was not our fault that we couldn't request dual fuel discounts, for the same level of discount for our single fuel payments they would not do it either.Every year the electric supply is affected by weather or alleged repairs and there is often power surges in the system that blow the light bulbs , to many people, people have asked for advice and help, been told they would look into it then you hear nothing.Now they are putting up costs by 12% when they never put it down over the last five years when their oil costs went down, note when their oil costs are cheap they always say they can't send the benefits back to the customer because they buy upto a year ahead , then a year on they still don't give savings to the customers.They stink, we are moving to a green tariff company that will save of nearly £200 on our bills and be better for the environment , I suggest you do the same and stop letting them charge you for their apparent discounts given to other customers ( based on what was said on the news) they should take less profit for these services not charge other customers more to provide them.

1,"            Do not use British Gas homecare.Had a policy in place. Had the annual boiler service and engineer condemned the boiler. On finding our why, it was he couldn't inspect the flue!i have owned the property 4 years and it's always passed the cp12 with four different engineers.There is a service hatch for him to inspect said flue, however, he did not have the common sense to ask to see. (i wasn't at the property at the time)The CP12 clearly stated he couldn't inspect the flue.Complained to customer service, another engineer called and stated the flue was at a wrong angle, hold on, the cp12 clearly stated he couldn't inspect the flue.Another lie.i was told the engineer was at the property for 85 minutes, which is a complete lie, only 20minutes. Asked to see proof of this, but they won't send that..have asked to see the photos the engineer took of the flue he couldn't inspect - awaiting.I arranged an independent gas safety engineer to complete the gas safety, nothing wrong with the boiler or flue. A complete joke.To add insult to injury two days later i receive an email from BG asking if i would like them to repair my boiler at an additional cost, when there was nothing wrong with it!If this happened to an older person, it just puts the fear into them and british gas have made a nice boiler sale.My independent engineer used to sub contract for BG and was told he constantly received texts to up sell. really appalling service.Moral of the story british Gas covering their backs.

Despite their T&Cs saying they will repair it so its level they have refused to fix the issue.  There is a width of a pound coin around the hatch area and a 2cm gap.  How on earth BG thinks this is level is beyond me.  Don't anyone touch BG Home care as they don't care about after customer service.  Typical big company lacking empathy and concern.

1,"            Joined BG Home Care Agreement as a landlord on 13 oct 2013. On paper, what they offered looked great and gave extra peace of mind so that if tenants ran into any issue, they can contact them without hassle. Sounds good so far doesn't it? Yes it does, and even better for BG if you consider that since 13 Oct 2013 until the current date, 29 July 2017 (45 month period or just under 4 years), i have paid a total of £946.82 WITH only ONE callout in May 2017 to fix my boiler for the Tenant because it affected their hot water. What makes matters worse, when I called on them in May 2017 for a call out to understand the process (since i did not use their service in the past 3.5 years), i then communicated this to the Agent dealing with the Tenants. So all going according to plan, or at least so i thought! When the Tenants contacted BG, they them on more that one occasion that the Landlord's account is ""OUTSTANDING"", bearing in mind that I contacted BG before i contacted my Agent/Tenant, and BG told me it was fine for the Tenant to contact them directly by simply providing the flat's address. Note that by this time in May 2017, I made every single monthly payment amounting to by that time,  approximately £850 in payments WITHOUT a single call out since i joined BG on 13 Oct 2013. By this time, the Tenants and Agent questioned me about how I could put them in a situation where my account was ""outstanding"" at a time when they needed their hot water to be restored. After this, I contacted BG again and asked why someone at the Call Centre did not inform me that my account was outstanding. The second Call Centre Agent at this time said that even though I was up to date with my payments, they said to the Tenants that my account WOULD BE outstanding if an Engineer visited the property because i needed to pay a £60 excess in advance, to which i replied that I did not know that this was a precondition for someone to visit the property, given that i paid ALL my previous monthly payments since Oct 2014 and the Agent a week ago informed me that all that would need to happen is for the Tenants to call BG and provide my address details! I reluctantly provided my card details for the £60 excess, even though it was not deducted from my account at that time. I arranged with the Tenants, but when the time came for BG to visit the property on a Saturday, the BG engineer indicated that nobody was at the property, even though the Tenants were at home since they did not have hot water for over a week by that time and were desperate for the issue to be resolved. Anyhow, at that time, I was abroad, and my Agent then contacted BG to escalate the matter. The BG Engineer then successfully resolved the issue days later, but the money was not deducted from my card for whatever reason at that time. I then received notices to pay the £60 which i eventually settled this week, even though I gave the go ahead in May 2017 to deduct it from my card. When I contacted the BG Online Agent this morning to determine how many calls i and the Tenant had to make for this single Engineer visit, she indicated that i would need to send a letter via POST to request this information. i then asked why would i need to do this if all i wanted to know was how many times during 2017 i had to contact BG and I was not interested in the transcript details. This is all in the age of real time information, where the system that BG uses is a sophisticated multi million pound system where all the information about the customer touchpoints are available to the Agent once I provide them with my Customer Ref No.I could go on more but in the interest of my Sat afternoon, I think that most folks reading this understand the gist of my story! So the moral of the story is, if you want to donate a £1,000 and get nothing or little in return, i suggest you better off donating this money to a charitable organisation where at the very least you will have some assurance that it will be of benefit to someone instead of an organisation such as this that is solely interest in collecting money but not prepared to return that with efficient service. Do yourself a favour please and don't put yourself through this. Your time and money can be spent better elsewhere.Cheers

1,"            absolute nightmare. It has been taking me nearly 5 months just to set up an account with british gas. I've called them over 20 times, just to set up an account and in the first couple of phone calls, there was a discrepancy in the information I was given; our flat was set up with a different gas/electricity provider, our gas was provided by british gas but not electricity, unable to find our address etc. Finally after hours of phone calls someone finally found out that our flat was under a business account rather than a domestic. After clearly being told that they would start making the switch and would call back, I did not. A week later I ended up calling them back, and having to explain my whole situation all over again- reading out my name, address, the issue, and what I was told before...then I was told I was to receive a letter and email stating how british gas had received a previous complaint from myself, and would start the transition from a business to domestic account. Instead, I received a bill that was still in the business account rate, rather than a domestic rate- and no statement about whether they were going to start the transition by post, nor email. Then I had to call them back again and was told that they did see that a request had been made, but the change to a domestic account had not begun. This is absolutely getting ridiculous. Getting told the wrong misleading information time and time again is unprofessional, and an embarrassment for the company.  Please work on creating a more efficient system where the operators who answer customer calls can file in a notice, and ensure that these promises get carried out. There is no reason that this should have taken longer than at least two months- if what I was told was to happen as they said they would, this would not have carried out for such a long time.

1,"            Have rented a small property out for years. Always had British Gas Homecare.First issues started in couple years ago. When a agent told me over the phone Homecare was fine for landlords. Still had trust in British Gas so thought nothing of this. A year later they write to me I have do not have a landlords safety certificate, here is me thinking the annual check we got (pretty much the same thing) provided this. Basically this is where for YEARS I find out British Gas ""knowing"" this was a Landlords Property continued to take PAYMENT every month for a residential property, and with me phoning to double check this. Anyway long story short here come all the charges and ad ons, we pay them to go out and sort out what is a Mis-sold policy. Anyway get it sorted complained and received LIP service ""this is all my fault"", and cancel their policy and go with another company, who will get their review later turn out to be even more unprofessional.A year later am back with British Gas, more fool me. Get the engineer to go out do the Landlords safety cert everything great all passes. Great lets get on with our life.Anyway tenants call engineer out a few days later, suddenly an issue with the boiler, (the only time there has ever been issues with the boiler is when a British Gas engineer touches it) . Engineer gets on phone tells me they wont fix the boiler, says it needs a new part. Check is boiler safe, he says YES.(he is trying to sell me a new boiler). Anyway I say thanks very much. Phone Worcester Bosch gets a PROPER engineer out, and put a brand new £2500 with 8 year warranty in, great little machine, plus he will for £60 a year do my certificate.What tipped me over the edge they proceeded to try and SELL me a POWER flush for over £700 on a boiler they claimed was faulty. Anything just to SELL you something.Just had the LIP service phone call.  Now knowing a former British Gas engineer I know they a being PRESSURED into selling vastly inflated new boilers. The engineers are on SALES targets, this is wrong, we are talking about People's safety here and should be illegal.MY first thought  when I was told my boiler was not working  IS IT SAFE. This is the last thought in the engineer's head. Companies like British Gas are what is pushing RENTS up in the UK, I have lost complete trust in this company, in their engineers skills, there customer service, in the whole company,My advice CANCEL the policies they are a CON purely to make British Gas profit, there engineers are not trained right, they DO not take take safety first, as they are being pressured to sell new boilers. Get a NEW boiler with a long warranty and get a proper local engineer to do your checks and certificates. They will probably leave a generic response to this review but they deserve it. Gas can be lethal and they cannot be trusted to carry out a proper assessment as they are being pressured to SELL for profit.I could have got two new boilers with the money they have had off me over the years. All British Gas care about is making money out of you.

5,"            Scottish Gas falls under the umbrella of British Gas !!!!I have been renovating my home after renting it out for years. Out of all the works from top-named companies, the installation of my new boiler was the best done job ever. It involved a chimney being installed through the roof and electrical mains work. The installer had each qualified fitter arrive at the time necessary and all the workers were clean, professional and respectful. I was taken-aback by the tidiness and lack of dust once the work was completed. The boiler is amazing too. Quiet and efficient !

Booked for today between 2 to 4. Phone call at 2.30 to say cannot attend! Refused to transfer me to customer services.  I asked for a call back in 10 minutes. Told it will be up to manager if he does so! Unbelievable. We have visitors coming tomorrow and have had 3 wasted appointments within the course of 5 days. I suspect we will not get a phone call.UPDATEHi Sarah. No call back so we phoned customer relations in the end. We were offered another £30 to stop the complaint . We asked for the complaint to proceed and were told we would get a call back by Friday. Of course we haven't heard anything and it is now Saturday.  I suspect this will be going to the Ombudsman.

We did receive a phone call at 08.00 hrs.the next morning, 27th June, which MAY or MAYNOT have been in connection with the work to be carried out, as NO REFFERANCE was made to them calling on behalf of British Gas, GIVEN the number of SCAMS and SALES calls, I declined to continue.Later that morning we contacted British Gas to be told they had NO RECORD of the work to be done. This was however sorted out, with the work to be carried out on the date, 28th June, as previously agreed., though we now had to cancel long standing regular meeting, to accommodate the NEW times.From here on in everything went well again,a friendly and efficient engineer  carried out the work and the waste was removed as agreed.

1,"            My recommendation is you do not trust these bunch of cowboys with your hard earned cash. Better to save the money you would have spent each month into a kitty for unexpected repairs. My experience of British gas home care heating is appalling. Our hot water tank started leaking quite badly in April causing a minor flood. Upon contacting British gas we were told dyno rod would be attending to sort out the problem. Their engineer confirmed we needed the tank replacing and this was done a week later, bearing in mind that we had to push for it to be done as were without hot water during this time. When you pay £800per year for this service you expect a certain level of commitment to customer care. That said, another engineer came to replace the tank. Slightly concerning was the fact that he seemed to spend a lot of time on the phone. When he eventually finished, he informed me that my shower pump was leaking, there had been nothing wrong with it prior to the fitting of the new tank. He went on to say that it was not down to him and that dyno rod don't cover shower pumps so there was nothing he could do. I employed a local plumber to inspect the pump, he confirmed it was damaged beyond repair. He took one look at the pipe work dyno rod had left us with and advised us to complain due to the shoddy workmanship. In addition to this he noticed the thermostat on the tank was set at 75degrees, much higher than the maximum 60 degrees for the pump and had likely caused the shower pump to break due to the extreme temperature of the water running through it. We did complain about this and the following day the water tank started leaking again from one of the ill fitted pipes and the central heating pump jammed, coincidental??!! a dyno rod engineer attended and said that the central heating pump was wired up wrong and that it was nothing to do with the previous dyno rod engineer's work but that he couldn't touch it as it was a British gas component . (do you see where I'm going with this!!). British gas then sent an engineer to fix the central heat pump, which to be fair he did and also sorted out air lock problems on the radiators we had experienced since the installation of the new tank. In all we have been badly let down by poor customer service (or lack of it). Our complaint was not taken seriously and we have been fobbed off. To make matters worse, when I inquired how much it would have cost to pay a local plumber to replace the tank I found it would have cost a fraction of what I wasted on British gas, plus a new shower pump that cost over £300 and I now have to pay for the shoddy work carried out by dyno rod to be rectified as their operations manager deemed it satisfactory!!!

Don't use this company unless you enjoy weeks of stress and hassle and being made to feel it's your fault for not having knowledge of gas fittings, pressure or plumbing!Update Still no meter! No gas leak and no reason meter can't be fitted to existing pipe work! That was opinion of engineer who had a wasted visit to sort a leak and change a connection ( not in his remit) that doesn't need changing. Complaint opened ages ago and so far £60 in compensation offered! Earliest time an engineer can now be booked for is 31st July! Looking into buying our own meter and having our gas safe plumber ( qualified in meterfitting) come on Tuesday and fit! Straightforward job based on his site survey!!!!

It turned out they had set us up incorrectly on their system yet again, so the cards they sent weren't linked.  They had several other transactions that  hadn't gone through either, so we had to type them all in manually on the smart meter screen.  They promised to ring me up early this week to let us know when our smart cards are useable. What a farce. We are worried now about when they eventually move us over to billed.  If prepay smart meters are difficult, god knows what they will do with billed. I'm watching the screen now every time we top up. And taking photos before and after.

1,"            British Gas messed up my credit rating. Manufactured debts I didn't owe. Registered "" Gone Away "" records when I informed them I was leaving the property. British Gas created multiple accounts for Gas and Electricity which ran at the same time. Whilst I was paying on another account they registered non payment on the other. My credit file has always been perfect till I joined British Gas. I moved from 5/5 to 1/5. I made a complaint to the Head Office. Initially one of the British Gas managers  MB agreed they had created multiple accounts and registered incorrect adverse information on my credit file. She promised to change it and to pay me compensation.  She contacted the British Gas department which deals with credit files.  They said they would only change a few accounts otherwise I would end up with perfect credit history. But that's what I had anyway. They refused to give in. Imagine British Gas was writing non payment on my credit file for my gas account when I had a prepayment meter.  I was repaying a very small debt using a prepayment meter.  British Gas said if they install a prepayment meter they still write non payment on your credit file for 6 months in case you don't top up your meter. I asked them to remove the credit non payment markers since I had topped up my meter for over a year. They still refused.  I told them I was switching supplier and applied and was accepted by another supplier.  I contacted MB at British Gas to tell her I was leaving British Gas. She told me she would not allow me to leave British Gas. To stop me she added over £1400 of debt to my account so British Gas can block the transfer. I complained to the Energy Ombudsman and submitted copies of my credit file. All my accounts were clear and paid for and then a sudden appearance of the debt added by MB from the British Gas head office.  The Ombudsman said based on the evidence they had no proof I owed British Gas and also because British Gas said I owed them they had no proof I didn't owe British Gas.  They suggested British Gas pay me £250 and apologise for "" shortfall in customer service "" and leave everything as it was. I refused the offer and I asked British Gas to take this to a Court of Law.  British Gas said they would not take me to Court and expected me to take them to Court instead.  I decided to move house in June 2016 to one which specifically did not have British Gas as supplier. I joined Robin Hood owned by a Council. My annual statement just came in and I was £420 in credit so my direct debit payment has been reduced to £1 per month.  British Gas has sent debt collectors more than 10 times this year and I have told them the whole truth. Debt collectors have told me they don't want my account and complained British Gas keeps sending it to them. I have now been assured by debt collectors ' managers I would never hear from them again. I had told them they would not collect what I did not owe on under the earth,  on earth, in heaven or in hell. Now I have peace.  British Gas messed my credit file but now I managed to get a credit card and am rebuilding my credit history.  As for the adverse information British Gas recorded I am happy to wait for 25 year till it's irrelevant.  I am sure by the time I retire the record won't exist. Plus I really don't need any credit.  I have bank accounts with overdrafts and a credit card.  Not sure what else I need. I have VOWED me, my household and my grandchildren will never be British Gas again.Rating: 1 but really it's a Minus 10. They are arrogant,  incompetent,  unprofessional and unhelpful bullies. I took my stand and will not bow. I hope one day the Courts with unmask British Gas to reveal who they really are.

They wrote to me to confirm this had been done. At the next billing, 5 months later I was in greater debt as they had only take £31.24 per month instead of £150 per month ... yes, you tell me how that could have happened! ..... so now my debt to them has doubled ...not good for me or them.

The engineer was due between 1200 and 1800 and I rang to ask when he was due to arrive but was told this information was unavailable. I kept checking the door and was later told that he had come and left a card; he must have come, left the card and gone quickly because i had checked the door only five minutes before this (i.e. before being told he had come and gone). I did not receive a phone call or text from the engineer and was also later told that my number had not been given to him - an unfortunate omission.

I complained to OFGEM still on going who said its a national problem and I should have been told this and offered me a goodwill gesture of GBP 50 pah! after sending British gas  over 20 emails, numerous telephone calls and texts and taking 2 days unpaid leave from work for their engineer to come in install it and when he did he said there was a problem.

1,"            Homecare is a pain and uselessOur landlord has arranged for the flat British Gas Homecare 'cover', which for me has proven to be useless twice - once the water was leaking + water cut-off for the flat not working, which they promised to come and fix urgently but eventually just din't show up, leaving us waiting awake throughout the night with water constantly flowing. At the end the situation forced our landlord to call another, more responsible provider (Pimlico Plumbers) and pay extra for what should have been included in the 'cover'. Today the boiler broke down, but even having called them before 11:00, British Gas refused to fix the problem on the same day unless I have a medical condition, explaining their refusal by them not having planned enough engineer visit 'slots' to have any available. In addition, the slots they offer next week are all at least half-day, which certainly is unsuitable for anyone employed, and much worse than some other services that nowadays can offer more certainty with 1 - 2 hour slots. Also laughing at the customer on the phone when one requests to speak to the manager doesn't add anything positive to the experience. British Gas Homecare is to be avoided if you don't want constantly pay for cover that in practice is useless (the only 'benefit' is annual gas check, but even that requires taking at least half-day holiday each time in order to accommodate them).

Following a brief time lapse since work on my boiler was completed on several occasions, my boiler continues to have a serious vibration problem which is the root cause of attached parts making a loud noise. The root cause, however, has still not been resolved - something within the boiler mechanism  is not functioning properly since a water leak was stopped and a replacement diverter fitted. Prior to this, no vibration was apparent . Attending to various symptoms will not resolve the primary cause of the vibration.

If you show them a receipt for a carpet that is just 6 months old, now damaged due to a pipe not being shut off correctly, they should, no questions asked replace the carpet and underlay out of respect to the customer.  Not BG, they want to come and clean the carpet, then and only then will they decide in their opinion if it needs replacing?  When two people come out on separate occasions to have a look and don't even lift the carpet to look at the underlay, true unprofessionalism. There will be no other outcome than the one that BG desire as they use their own insurance company, centrica and want nothing more than to save costs.  Bullying tactics due to being a large company.  I have paid over £5000 to have shocking after service, shame on British Gas.Thank you for your reply Gemma, That's great that you want to come and clean the carpet that British Gas have damaged, I will hop on a plane and come from Scotland to allow you into the property, the property was let at the time the boiler was being replaced, the tenants have since moved out.  As I am awaiting the fourth round of surgery on my leg following an accident, I have not re let due to the stress of this.  I originally let the property due to no longer being able to do stairs, I now live in Scotland to be closer to family at such a stressful time.  It will actually cost me more in air fare from Scotland to Berkshire,  than it would for the carpet to be replaced.  Am I being unreasonable here, I don't think I am.  Are British Gas being unfair, in my opinion yes.  The carpet is not of great value £550 including fitting, when the cost of the boiler change was so high £5000.  If you are a customer looking into British Gas you make up your own minds whether or not British Gas are fair.

2,"            To be fair up to this incident my experiences with British Gas have been excellent unfortunately on this occasion it has not.After buying a new boiler from British Gas and taking out a homecare plan it was time to renew my landlord gas safety check, this would be the 2nd with British Gas, the engineer arrived passed the boiler and hob then proceeded to the gas meter in the communal basement. My tenant was waiting for him to return but he didn't.  A few days later I received a letter saying I had failed the check as the engineer couldn't access the meter as he didn't have the key, ( on prior occasions They always carried an fb key and had  no  problem accessing the meter ) . I was then told I'd have to pay £82 for him to return.I was told he informed my tenant that the property had not passed the check, he didn't.I then received an invoice for £29.95 for the fitting of a carbon monoxide alarm, no alarm was fitted by the engineer. I already had a carbon monoxide alarm.When british gas fitted my boiler the engineer  carried an fb key, when I had my 1st gas safety check they had an fb key but on this occasion no, plus the mystery carbon monoxide alarm?Maybe I was unlucky on this occasion, as I mentioned earlier I've had nothing but praise for British Gas prior to this. Disappointed.

1,"            Extremely disappointed with British gas . An issue has been going on for more then a year, I have made complaints to staff and managers, by phone, emails. ,  and written letters. But unfortunately it was just a waste of time.. they close my account 7 times. When I call they tell me we though that you  left the house and we will open you r account again. Then I receive 2 bills with 2 different account number one was mine and other is my neighbours bill to pay that's a total of £ 1789. I made another complaint and all what I got a lady on the phone telling me you pay then you complain and when I tried to explain.she I told me that she's been at british gas for over 10 years and she knows what she is doing. I had to call another gentleman he notice straight away that this something wrong and he apologise for his experienced collegue. Then when I payed my bill after a week my account was closed again and same story repeated itself from 2015. All what I can say British gas is a scam and still sending me neighbours bills to pay. All what I'm asking now is to sort out this issue. Close my account. Pay my final bill and look for another company who at least have customer service. Forgot to mention now they sending me warning letters for failing to pay neighbours bills and when I call they tell you there is an ongoing issue and managers are looking to it. They promise to sort out the issue in less then a month but now it has been for years. Who ever want a bad experience join British gas  they provide energy true but they take all your energy and time and money dealing with them. British gas you completely a failure from customer service to management.

1,"            Some of the worst customer service I have ever come across. My father and I spent months trying to change names on two family accounts, and they were completely unable to do this. As a result bills were sent to the wrong address, I was unable to access the online account for my flat, and I was also unable to submit meter readings. Complaints department appear to have no function other than to send emails making false promises to resolve the situation.The above issue, which should have been quickly resolved, led to me losing all confidence in the supplier. I have now switched, and should have done so sooner.

1,"            Terrible experience with my smart meter, I received a bill for over £600 and after questioning this found out that my smart meter has not been working properly since April 2016.  The only notification from BG is a small red triangle on the smart meter that sends an alert asking you to contact them.  As this was my first experience with a smart meter I didn't know how to check the alerts and only found out there was a problem after contacting them about the large bill I had received.  This was the one and only notification from BG that it wasn't working properly, there was no letter or any other sort of notification, after making a complaint I was told that smart meter messages are system generated and there would be no other way that they could notify you that there had not been an up to date meter reading. They would not send you a letter asking for a manual reading or to sort out an engineer visit, that is in the hands of the customer!I am on a low income and try to ensure that my bills are kept up to date, I thought that a smart meter was meant to ensure you don't fall into debt, unfortunately this is not the case.  It is infuriating that I also signed into a new contract with BG in November based on incorrect meter reading and will be tied into this until next year unless I pay £40 to move to another supplier, after doing a comparison this week I could have saved over £300 with another supplier.I have made a complaint and have been offered £20 credit to my account, but this in no way makes up for the terrible service I have received.  I sent an email outlining why I was so upset but just received a cut and paste response that ignored all the issues I had outlined.Extremely disappointed with BG, I will take my complaint to the ombudsman, and advise that you should not go with BG, their smart meter technology is awful and their response to a customer complaint is terrible DO NOT GO WITH THEM!!!!!!

1,"            A BG engineer came to our property to fix a leak on Thursday 6th July. He was supposed to come together with a builder who would provide access, but for some reason he turned up without the builder so we had to book for him to come back a second time once the builder had been. We discussed with him that he would come back on Monday, but subsequently called the main line and moved the appointment to Friday 7th July (we told the operator that the engineer might refer to a Monday booking but that we actually wanted Friday). We got the confirmation text and waited in on Friday morning, but then received a text on Friday morning saying that the appointment had been moved to Monday (despite our instructions to the operator). When we called back we were told that an appointment on Friday was no longer available, so we rebooked for Saturday morning. We received the confirmation text and waited at home all morning on Saturday, but no engineer came. We called the main line several times and were told that the booking system was down all weekend, but that if we had received a confirmation text then someone would definitely be coming. When we called again at Ipm we were told that we were not on the roster of properties for the engineer to visit and that no-one was coming. We therefore booked again for Monday 10th July between 8am and 1pm. I called at 10am to check status and was told that the engineer was on his way. I called again at 11.30am and was again told that the engineer was on his way. I called again at 12.30pm and was told that the engineer would come at 3pm. I called again at 3.30pm and was told that a scheduler would call me back within five minutes with an update (no-one called me back). I called again at 5.30pm and was told that the engineer would not be turning up at all, and that the earliest they can come is tomorrow morning. I am yet to see whether or not anyone actually turns up tomorrow. Each of these calls involved waiting on hold for up to half an hour before getting through to speak to someone. Furthermore, we have a two year old daughter who has now been cooped up in the house for three days rather than going outside while we/our nanny wait at home for non-existent engineers. I find it completely inexplicable that BG can fail to send an engineer for three days in a row.  Once is bad enough (BG have failed to turn up for me on previous occasions as well), but three times in a row...? It is bad enough that we are given timing windows of 4-6 hours, but if I can't have confidence whether anyone will turn up at all while waiting in all day the homecare service becomes entirely unfit for purpose.  Just to add insult to injury, I tried to send this compliant via the online form on the BG website, and was just given an error message. This is among the worst customer service I have ever encountered.

1,"            After initially calling to query an unusually high bill on my step dads account, I am a named nominee on, after deciding to switch suppliers. I ended up dealing with a lady who could not provide me with significant or relevant information and kept on changing what she said, mentioning direct debits being changed without our prior authorisation and then being told by said consultant to log an indemnity claim with the bank.  Quite scary for an FCA regulated firm to do this. This was Saturday just gone, she then proceeded to put the phone down on me despite me not swear or getting aggressive on the phone.  So I then called back and spoke to someone called Sheila, who showed slightly more empathy however apparently could not get in her systems and could not find any notes from the previous consultant, I then explained my issues again asking for call recordings, proof that we have agreed to a variable direct debit in writing and also stating that we did not agree to the bill especially as no proper notification had been made to us.  She logged this as a complaint and called me back today stating that a letter had been sent out in the post which ironically we never received.  I said that I still wanted to log this as a complaint.  I called back later on today as I had no time left earlier, spoke to someone who said they couldn't hear me properly and then put the phone down on me.  Then called back spoke to a man called lake who I then explained some of the issues to again and then he decided to transfer me to another agent who had no idea what I was talking about.  He then proceeded to put me on hold for ages without knowing what was going on when I asked to speak to a manger.  I then called back and spoke to a Lady called Jess explained my issue and then asked to be put through to a manager, who I was then put through to again I discussed the issues and how unsatisfied I was and again questioned this (Variable direct debit) which I was told we put in place because you cancelled with us.  Steven was very unprofessional and started bringing his personal opinions into my complaint saying that he would only give us £10 for the issues we had and thats about all he would give us.  every time I tried to ask questions he would deliberately answer in a way to avoid the specific question as he then claimed that the confirmation of this change had been sent via email and when I asked three times did you send it by post completely avoided the question saying we sent it via email.  It then got to the point in which I was getting fed up so I said I would like copies of the call and Steven went on to say what is it you actually want.  I explained this and tried to end the conversation saying to Steven that we are going round in circles but he continued to deliberately act coy and eventually said he would give me copies of the call but it would take time and that he would call me back in a week to tell me when he could get copies of the call I asked for a more specific time frame to be denied.  This consultant even said that the company would welcome my complaint to the energy ombudsman. I then got so frustrated I had to end the call.  It is a shame that people like Steven are even allowed to work for such large companies and in todays modern age when companies can have the rug swept from under their feet by new competitors with new technology and better service, when people are loosing jobs to technology people like this are allowed to try and play god because they are on the end of the phone.  Moral of the story in my opinion try someone else. Give one of the smaller suppliers a chance I am sure they will appreciate it more.

1,"            They left us without power for 2 days and refused to take responsibility for the problem! We had a meter exchange from 'pay as you go' to a billing meter! A British Gas engineer came, disconnected the power and then did not connect the new meter to the consumer board. As a result we had no power coming to the house. I spent hours trying to book an emergency engineer who came the next day to say that this is not his responsibility! I spent another 2 hours on the phone to British Gas to finally be told that reconnecting the power is not their responsibility and we need to get an electrician to do it! I had done the same exchange with E-On on another property and they reconnected everything so that we had uninterrupted power supply. British Gas do not connect your electricity back and they don't tell you that either! Nobody explained to us that this is the case! We found out 24h after the power cut and it took us another day to sort it out! This is absolutely appalling!

1,"            We Have had a homecare plan with BG for a about 1 year paying around £45 per month. Overall I would NOT recommend their services it's simply not worthit. we have had to call them out on a few occasions;The 1st problem was related to a non-efficient toilet flush, BG kept sending out their subcontractor Dyno-rod who said they couldn't fix the problem as it didn't cover it in their contract..but would leave ridiculous quotes from their own company for the repairs. Ended up getting a private plumber to sort out the mess for a reasonable rate.The 2nd occasion my boiler wasn't working and they did manage to send out their own engineer within reasonable time and replace some parts with additional costs of £60 (excess fee). The 3rd occasion I had a non working light and they sent an electrician over who briefly looked at it and said it's too risky for him to work on. unfortunately the bulb still hasnt been repaired. Just today I rang them with regards to a different light related issue. In one of the ground floor rooms I have a light switch which is stiff and is difficult to switch Off. The guy on the line goes he needs an excess of £60 before he can send anyone, They have said this to me on several occasions before but never return the excess fee back. once I managed to claim one excess fee back from them after difficult phone conversation. now till this day they send me threatening letters with regards to reclaiming that excess fee of £60.So I see their services some what as a scam as they trick people by billing them for unnecessary charges for jobs they won't even do. Just to add they don't give a precise time off when their engineer/subcontractors will come it's within a 6hour time period whereby they call you 10 minutes before they arrive, so pretty much you have to make sure someone is closeby within that 6 hour gap, pretty tedious.

They advised a refund would be sent within a couple of weeks.  Over 3 months on I have just received a cheque for just over half with no explanation as to why.  I called them and their agent was useless and could not offer an explanation and I was advised to email.  Also given my mum has passed away I find it VERY INAPPROPRIATE to send a letter titled ""We're sorry to see you go"", which then goes on to say ""if you ever want to come back simply let us know"".

The engineer arrived and fiddled with it for a minute and then the water started gushing out instead of dripping when flushing.  He fiddled a bit more, slowed the leak bit it was still much worse than when he arrived and said he would be back the next day, so I was left constantly changing towels overnight but the carpet was already soaked.It was eventually fixed but the Dynorod attitude of leaving me with a problem worse than when he arrived and not even bothering to close it down to stop the leak was appalling.

1,"            British Gas promised me a Smart Meter when I had a new gas installation with them. Once the gas was installed, they arrived with an old box type meter - no Smart meter for electricity or gas.The excuse was that the meters were incompatible with the network.I then found out that my neighbour next door had a Smart Meter with a different electricity supplier! No issues with compatibility next door.British Gas have lied to me and their advertisements about Smart Meters for their customers are misleading the public.This is a Trading Standards issue and it is very clear that even with a completely new gas installation, I was promised a Smart Meter but then that promise was broken.I am now moving to a new supplier. I also intend to contact Trading Standards as I believe their advertisement is misleading.I would not recommend this company to anyone.The initial connection for gas was a complete nightmare too!

1,"            British gas is utterly unprofessional and ridiculous. I recently moved into a new property with my partner. We are both employed and on a combined income well above £80000 a year. We both have excellent Experian Credit scores somewhere around 965. We asked British gas if it was possible to exchange the pay as you go gas meter in our new home for a credit meter. This was not possible initially, due to a negative balance on the pay as go meter left by the previous tenants.We had already put 50 pounds in the meter at this point to bring it up to a balance of 0, but apparently there was some more hidden debt on it as the lady one the phone explained it. We were told we would be refunded this money as it wasn't our debt and that the hidden debt we shouldn't worry about at all as an engineer could sort this for us. British gas gave us a different appointment time than the engineer, so the appointment had to be rescheduled because of this. After completing the appointment, we called back about the meter switch, British gas proceeded to try and credit check me, but found that due to having lived abroad for a few months two and a half years ago They wouldn't be able to credit check me. It didnt matter that I lived in the UK since 2003. Nevermind other companies being capable of getting a credit check. We were then advised that the account should be transferred to my partner so we could get the credit check working. Because it was too late in the day, it was agreed my partner would call them back the next day to complete the transaction. When he called back, he was then told that switching the account to his name would not be possible unless I was present too. We wouldn't have minded if that's the case, but we were specifically told otherwise the day before.After another series of pointless phone calls the transfer of ownership was finally completed. During the switch phone call we were harassed into accepting and paying the previous tenant's debt that alledgedly had been cleared during the engineers visit. According to British Gas, nothing could be done for us unless we accept. So grudgingly we agreed to pay sixty pounds nothing to do with us to get this situation resolved on top of the 50 we had already paid. Things progressed. Turns out that my partner didn't pass the credit check requirement as an Experian score of 996 or higher is required to qualify for a credit meter. Apparently, he fell a few points short. We were also asked multiple times about British Gas's internal workings and procedures and which workflow they were supposed to to follow with our concern. How would we know? We don't work there. I would expect customer service representatives of a company to be sufficiently trained to process a customer query.We were advised that we will not be able to reapply or have this rectified for another 60 days. Seriously cannot recommend. Very expensive pricing and appalling treatment of customers. I'll not even go into the long wait times on the phone and the fact that their call handling system seems to not recognise your inputs unless you press the keys really, really slowly.

1,"            British Gas fitted my central heating boiler and from the outset it looked, and was, a disaster. Three years later is seems that the fitter had left out an essential flue gasket allowing carbon monoxide to leak into our kitchen and ‘condensate’ to rot out the boiler’s combustion box, so a new boiler was needed. Their installation Manager suggested a solution that both the manufacturer and GasSafe say was unsafe. Their Area Manager fully supported this action so there is clearly a culture here that puts profit ahead of safety. British Gas would accept no responsibility, refused even communicate after the initial complaint contact, until the Retail Ombudsman was contacted and forced them to make reparation. Forget the sweet little penguin, simply leave them alone (or use them to set your maximum budget) and use a, locally recommended, GasSafe registered installer (ask to see their GasSafe badge and on the rear it will tell you if they are qualified to fit the type of device that you want fitted, or check out their credentials at the gassaferegister web site under 'find-an-engineer' ). This will almost certainly cost you less and, from my experience, you and your family will probably be safer.Top Tip: You can request, within six months of installation, that an inspector from the GasSafe Register checks that the work has been carried out correctly. This facility is quite difficult to find so go to the gassaferegister web site and search for  'nominate-your-appliances-for-inspection'Reply to Jamie-LeeThanks Jamie-Lee, you are the first person in British Gas to come back without prompting.However, unless you are on speaking terms with Matthew Bateman then I don't think you can help. (If you are then perhaps you could ask him why, as British Gas CEO, he has a centrica e-mail address rather than a British Gas one. Is he ashamed of what he works for? - Well, understandable if so.)The Southern Regional Heating Manager (O'Hara/O'Mara) and his 'SMT' fully supported the local line manager in proposing an action that has been deemed unsafe by everyone else so I would not expect you to get any reasonable response from him and, in any case, British Gas has been made to recompense me. An apology for the way that they acted and the risk they exposed my family to might have been nice but hey, this is British Gas... Regards

1,"            Me and my student household were unable to switch energy providers because of an objection to the transfer, caused by our current energy provider. We did not know who the provider was because we had just moved in and had not received any letter from a supplier. In October 2016 British Gas told us they weren't our energy provider, then 5 months later we found out they in fact were our provider. In that time they had been charging us their most expensive business rate. Had they told us in Oct that they were our provider we could have paid what we owed until that point (we only moved in in Sept '16) and switched to a considerably cheaper provider. Instead, the 8 of us each paid £150, despite barely using the gas throughout the winter. Even once we had found out they were the provider, in subsequent phone calls they said we weren't, and then suddenly plucked a figure for our meter readings out of thin air. In March '17 my housemate got them to agree to recalculate the bills based on a cheaper, personal household rate, and refund us the difference. 4 months later and they still have not managed to recalculate this. They're now requesting information from us about our new energy providers rates and our current usage - information that is totally irrelevant for a simple recalculation. I'm pretty sure it's not that difficult to recalculate the bill based on a different rate, I could do it in about 60 seconds!!They are utterly useless and owe us hundreds of pounds, and now they are seemingly doing whatever they can to avoid paying out. A 4 month wait is not good enough and it doesn't look like we'll be getting what we're owed any time soon!

App didn't submit my gas meter read correctly, but did submit the electric reading. Direct debit increased in the winter because of higher use (surely you would think they would wait until the summer to compensate?). After a house move, cancelled the old house account even though we were still responsible for it for a couple of months which meant the landlord got a letter and thought we had stopped paying!

1,"            Terrible experience from start to finish.  Switched to British Gas last year and they completely messed up the switching process, switched wrong house, wrong meter readings.  Told impossible to install smart meter even though I had one already installed from previous supplier.  After switching to new supplier this year they even got that process wrong.  Used wrong final meter readings then proceeded to enforce wrong amount immediately with their debt collection agency.  Avoid at all costs.

It took a grand total of EIGHT phone calls, a ridiculous phone bill and raised blood pressure over the course of several months to finally get rid of this monstrous company. How can they still monopolise the market with their overpriced, dreadful service. I would rather sit in the dark with a camp fire than give them any more of my money.

That was a bit disappointing and it took two further visits, as parts were required that needed to be ordered, however the various staff all turned up more or less on time, and all were professional, and the boiler is now fixed; so the end result was satisfactory.

We moved in to our adapted house for disabled people 5 weeks ago and still have no gas card to top up there prepayment meter. 21 phone calls and over 3 hours on the phone to different members of there customer service people. 5 of them said a card would be posted out the same day,  all 5 customer service employees failed to send cards out. Others had us driving over 20 mile round trip to collect gas cards that all failed when there codes were put in., one c service monkey actually gave us a electricity code to try and use. Spent over a hour talking to there complaints department today who at first promised to send a card out today then called back saying there was a card ready in a shop two miles away with a code ready installed. Collected the card and to no suffice it was invalid when cash was put on it. Now they say they want to come on Monday to reset the meter for a second time as it might not have been done correctly 5 weeks ago.  They haven't even said they'd pay my travel for collecting all theses cards.  It's Friday now so another weekend with no hot water. They even had the cheek to tell me that when I do manage to top up that they will take 10 pounds off me straight away for weekly service charge on a meter that supplies no gas.

I switched from Collective Fix February 2017 tariff to HomeEnergy FreeTime Sat tariff earlier in 2017.I have used British Gas Tariff Check tool. It advised me that I will end up paying around £5 more a year by switching to HomeEnergy FreeTime Sat. Happy days! I do understand that it was an estimate and the final bill depends on my usage, but if the usage is the same I will end up paying £5 more a year.However, my bill from British Gas became significantly higher and not as advertised by the Tariff Check tool. For example, Jan 2017 I was on my old tariff and I have used 3024kw which was £103.41. In March 2017 on the new tariff I used 1996kw which was 107.48. The difference is astonishing as you can see. I have used one third less energy, but ended up paying more. How does that work out £5 more a year?

1,"            Oh British gas are wonderful people, wonderful that is, while they are selling and fitting a new boiler to the tune of £2,900, there is supposed to be a 5year warranty with itAfter it,s been fitted YOU can whistle.,and your 5  year warranty ain't worth the paper it's not printed on.I have had a peculiar high pitched series of 2 beeps, at random intervals from our lovely new Vaillant boiler,  throughout the day and night, and it,s driving the wife and I up the proverbial wall.So I complained,as you do, firstly on the 27th May, and got a lovely email back saying all will be well and fixed in 3 days, 3 days came and went, so I emailed them again 2nd June and said that their idea of three days must be different from mine,and enclosed the random times that this high pitched beep occurred that morning another lovely email, saying we're looking into things for you, now that's extended it by another 3 days.It is now  7 yes 7 days since I complained , and we are no further forward in getting this fixed.We are getting bombarded by emails telling me how to make an official complaint, .Oh Yeah, who do I complain to , British Gas, thats one for the books ain't it, who polices the police, BUT WE ARE STILL GETTING HIGH PITCHED BEEPS, what would happen if I had , say a gas leak, we,ll be looking into it for you, and you should get a reply in 3 days, too late, boom.No wonder people are leaving British Gas in droves!!!!!!!!!!Just a little update, it is now the 6th June, 11, yes 11 days since I first complained, I won,t even bother to comment, let the facts speak for themselves

1,"            I have to say that having boiler insurance with British Gas is one of the worse decision I have ever made to this date. I am having Home Care 4 in the last 2 years, which is the most comprehensive cover you can have with them. Every time I call them for an issue with my boiler, their engineers and customer relation managers come with every possible loophole and excuse not to pay up. Recently, I am in a row with them over an issue that clearly is their responsibility to step up and fix the faulty part in the boiler. However, since I told them about another issue with my radiators last year, they accounted that as an excuse for causing the issue with the boiling part of my boiler. I asked them how they could be related but their customer relation managers replied back by saying they are related and BG is not responsible for fixing the part. This is a message for British Gas (customer relation managers): Rather than spending thousands of pounds on TV ads to give false information to customers, spend fraction of that money to provide services to your genuine existing customers. Not only you have lost my custom for ever, I am doing all I can to let everyone know about how poor your services really are.

1,"            I don't normally bother writing negative reviews as I try to resolve issues before it gets to this. We are on a service plan and have just had the boiler serviced. When the engineer arrived there was no leak. It's a relatively new boiler and it has a shiny granite surface beneath so we would have noticed any water dripping on to it. The engineer worked on the boiler for a while and then told us we had a leak - and that we would have to pay £99 excess charge to get it fixed! There was no leak before he started 'servicing' the boiler and on leaving he put a container underneath to catch the drips. In a short space of time it has filled to a couple of millimetres - I think we would have noticed if this leak existed before he arrived as the granite surface would have been covered in water! Our conclusion? It is blindingly obvious that somehow the work the engineer did has caused a leak.But not according to British Gas!My husband has been on the phone for nearly half an hour being told by customer services that it was a 'pre-existing fault'. They ARGUED with my husband and are not prepared to accept any responsibility. This seems to be a common theme with British Gas - what ever happened to the customer being right?

1,"            I had a engineer come do a annual boiler check, he ticked off all the checks and signed it off. Then the boiler filter started leaking! So i had to get another british gas engineer out to look at it, he actually knew what he was doing, but he said that the first engineer did not check it at all, it was impossible to check as it is locked/seized and wouldn't budge. So british gas rip you off, dont do the job correct and seeing as though it is GAS related it is a very serious matter! I had to fork over £255 to British gas for a new £80 filter to be installed to stop the leaking (1 hour to fit). Absolute joke, It wasn't leaking until the british gas guy came over, so i'm sure he tried to get into it and when he couldn't move it he left it slightly open. If it was leaking before he came then why has it been signed off? Why isn't there damaged chipboard flooring under the boiler? Chipboard doesn't do well with water so that says it all really.Either way: he damaged it or didn't even check it and signed it off as checked!

1,"            Terrible customer service with No Customer tracking. After running through my British Gas bill with the customer service team for 30 minutes and nearly coming to a resolution over a hefty bill which is an error on their behalf, we unfortunately were cut off. After calling back to fix the issue, I was bounced between 3 different agents in the  Energy and Home team for 15 minutes with no resolution or assistance and no awareness of my issue as they have no notes on their system.I have wasted nearly 45 minutes of my time with no outcome. Terrible Accounting, Bad customer service, and awful customer tracking. The customer is definitely not at the heart of this multi national company.

1,"            British Gas Smart Metering. If only the company could get smart, Specific, measurable. Achieveable, Realistic Timely.Actually they are useless, even with support from customer relations and months of failed visits to commission, weeks of waiting for system to be updated, failures to update there own customer manager and days of wasted customer time. I went back to British Gas on the basis they improved from 8 years ago when they flooded my house so far smart metering x 6 visits still not resolved!!!!!!!Tumble dryer visit to repair as not heating x3 visits. Not heating ypu would say heating element but for visit decided it was pcb and a switch - 2nd visit fitted pcb and switch and not working.3rd visit withtwo engineers decided to change heating element and guess what - working in 5 mins. Now were they having a quiet day and bulking the job adding to the cost of the product.Faith in BG - none they dont deserve a star but you have to give oneThey want another appointment now to try again. Engineer also left meter cupboard open and unlocked, may not seem a big deal but as in a 4 year old disabled bedroom we are just glad his carer found out before he did!My faith in BG is rock bottom, do not use them.

1,"            I was invoiced over £1200 by mistake back in Sept 2016. This I was told was a meter error and would be investigated. In the meantime I was told by British Gas ""Do not make any payments until the matter is resolved"". I was also told that the payment requests would be put on hold and my account frozen until the matter was sorted.It's now 9 months later and I'm still awaiting an outcome. In this time I have received 10s of threatening emails, phone calls, texts and letters from British Gas and a debt collection company (2 phone calls on bank holiday Mondays). I've also been threatened with disconnection 3 times. Every time I speak to British Gas they apologise, tell me that the case is still under investigation and that the account will be frozen again. The left arm has no idea what the right arm is doing because within a few days the threats and harassment starts again. I explain the situation for the umpteenth time and if I'm lucky the advisor will read the notes, apologise and promise a resolution soon. I have 12 accounts with British Gas Business, all of which will soon be with new suppliers. I have had several more dreadful customer service experiences with British Gas. I strongly recommend steering well clear of this highly inept and disfunctional company.1 June 2017 - have emailed as you advised Jamie-Lee, I will update this review once it is finally resolved.16 June 2017 - I'm still awaiting a reply to my email Jamie-Lee.29 July 2017 - I received a letter to say that a £100 cheque would be sent to me due to this matter being mishandled and delayed but I've received another debt collection agency phone call, a final demand labelled envelope and an amended incorrect bill with estimated readings and a £45 charge for the debt collection agency involvement. I'm now going to the regulator.

Another week without supply and the original engineer turned up  , apologized for his error   but could  not rectify the fault and left, .

Telephoned as they have yet again got the totally wrong meter reading, it is actually MORE than today's reading almost 6 weeks on. I was told. Firstly that the CSA I spoke to on the 2May had input the incorrect figure. Today I was given the total owing £201.70. Which is less than the bill received 10May for slightly more usage..... I have continually chased this final bill and provided the final reading on at least 3 separate occasions .I've put in an official complaint and asked for a proper explanation and some compensation for the wasted time I have spent the telephone. I was. Then told that our new supplier had given BG the reading ????? And asked for for contact details for our new supplier .....Someone doesn't seem to be telling me the truth do they ? And yes I am awaiting a call back .To actually be given the reading of 32447 mid April , they raised a bill on 32457 for some reason and then to receive a final bill with a meter reading of 32726 is beyond me especially as today 24may the actual reading is 32715 ...

This just got worse the staff in the office need to either brush up on their standard excuses n stick to the same reason or just be honest n say it's in a complete muddle then Prehaps as a ""valued"" customer I could reason with them but all they do is give out some information falsely.  The engineers that turned up are fantastic and very professional and friendly.   They were courteous and I genuinely was pleased with them even when the first guy couldn't fix it as he never had the parts needed I was still happy with the visit.  It seems to me that the centre you call to book appointments needs to sort themselves out to provide a smoother reliable service to customers.  We had no hot water if the boiler was on timer and heating that stayed on continuously even when NOT on scheduled timer even though it's a combination boiler.  Things were finally sorted 8 days after the first appointment was made this is totally disgusting when we're paying for a service and especially as my husband has chronic health and disabled.

I contacted British Gas and arranged for an Engineer to attend.  My partner took time of from work but the engineer never attended.  She called and rearranged a further appointment again the engineer did not attend and she was told that the engineer had attended the previous day but could not gain entry.  The engineer has lied as our home is covered by CCTV which proves that the engineer did not attend.  A further appointment was arranged and again no attendance.  A fourth appointment was arranged for an engineer to attend between the hours of 8-10am, it is now 10:30 and the engineer has not arrived.  I called at 9:45 and was told the engineer was on his way.  I called again at 10:10 and was again told by a very unhelpful person that the engineer was on his way.  I now have to go to work and still cannot get a shower.  This is what we are paying for, a service from a company whose staff have no integrity and a company who do not care about customers.

1,"            Absolutely rubbish.We took over a business about 2 years ago, we informed all the suppliers before we officially took over so that we were able to change the accounts into our's name. All the suppliers did that without hassle except for British Gas. Why? Because they were charging the previous occupier at a so much higher tariff as he could not understand English very well.I sent them multiple emails to inform them and they kept telling me to call the relevant department. Then every time I call, they said they could not discuss the matter with me because I am not the account holder!! DUH? I got really fed up but I was thinking you know what there was only a few months left until the contract came to an end so we were paying on behalf of the previous occupier. But when the time has come, they refused to end the contract with us as we are not the account holder!! Then I realised they were trying to ripped us off.

1,"            Useless engineers  After months and months of reporting faults for my water going cold and boiler kicking in at random  times and a water leak I have found the faults myself. I have taken photos now as evidence.  I had cancelled the contract and after getting fed up with it I decided to take it on myself.  I took the covers off and there was another cover that the engineers never took off as I watched them . There it was looking at me straight away  you can see where it's been leaking in two places. One was from the dhw  my wires. The connector was corroded from the on going leak. The other was at the bottom on the inlet water connection. Now tell me how 4 engineers and about 20 visits even from a senior engineer miss those 2 easy faults and then try and sell me a new boiler.  This is one for watchdog etc. I will be logging this with offgem .  If BGas wants to contact me your more than welcome to. I look forward to it

1,"            I moved into a property and the suppliers were yourselves. I was switching suppliers and closed my account with british gas.My bill was messed up multiple times and they went on estimated reading.When i rang up to make payment there was a massive confusion. I was told i had an outstanding payment of only £1 something, I raised this with the advisor that this is incorrect and should be around £37. However they went away and multiple times confirmed to me that no the whole account was only showing £1 something.I said to the company multiple times this is not correct and should be more, but with being reassured again it was not made payment which was outstanding.A couple of weeks later they have now come back to request payment of £37.... I don't normally complain but with me being honest and questioning the bill and being reassured they are now wanting payment.I am really really not happy with this or my experience it's gone from bad to worse and I will not being going back with this company or recommending as they just mess you around, no customer care at all.I was called on 18/05 and raised this as they wanted payment and said they would call me back at 12:30 on the 19/05 not heard anything and they said they don't want any extra charges to be added..... but they haven't called...so further to this they have just rang me at 19:40pm to advise i need to make payment, they have raised a complaint but said once i had made payment this was closed and when you raise a complaint they don't even call you... is this a business which looks after customer or is about money?  they took my payment and closed this and then asked me if i wanted to close the complaint which they had already done...

The company are a sham, they don't care about loyalty, their don't care about their prices, their staff are often lazy, don't follow things through and try to blame most things on the customer. I find their ever increasing profits to be a concern when they insist on ""wholesale price increases"" being the cause for putting their prices up, surely if your profits are sufficient you seek to find efficiencies to increase profitability rather than ripping off your customers? By putting their prices up AND increasing profitability it seems evident they are profiteering.Steer clear.

1,"            British Gas is the more worst company which I have ever been dealing with. I have moved out of my previous property in December 2016. Brtish Gas was informed of this day. I provided the meter readings for gas and electricity and I have been confirmed that after my final bill my account with British Gas will be definately closed and is no need to do anything more by myself.I promptly paid the amount asked and have paperwork confirming I paid the final bill and amount requested by the Company. As I have paid the Final Bill, I consider my financial obligations for my previous address to be finised.Unfortunately a  fiew weeks ago I received an email from BG stating I was £96.44 in credit. I phoned customer service regarding this email  and I was 3x  informed that I should expect a cheque enclosing the credited amount. I have also discovered that previous record relating to my contact with customer service has disappeared from my online accout which I could still access in full , despite having closed it. Despite this I have since received another bill requesting a further £85.34. I have contacted BG a several times as I received a several more emais where I am in credit or in debit and my on line accout was showing that hasn't benn closed at all !!! I have been informed by BG that my account hasn't been closed by BG staff corectlly in December 2016 as I moved out plus even my gas meter reading wasn't added to my accout. I found out as well that the final bill which I have payed has been with estimated reading!  The mess which BG staff left on my account is not acceptable! The conduct and attitude of British Gas has been deplorable. Over one month of my compalins I do not have a satisfactory outcome. BG Company is expecting from customers to pay for thier own staff mistakes. At the moment after 5 mounts in my new home BG staff is pushing me to deal with their own mistakes and the mess on the account with my name and previous assdress which should be not existing any more . I found this Company as a very unprofessional and unreliable. All this situation and mess on my acconut left by BG staff has cost me my time , my patience and caused unnecessary masive stress.   I won't recomend your company to anybody.

They decided to rectify the latter by installing an electric element into the towel rails. When they did this they caused 2 more water leaks resulting is damage to a newly plastered ceiling! When they came out to fix this second leak they decided to drain my boiler and leave me with no hot water or heating saying they will be back with the parts tomorrow!!!  You would think a heating engineer could join two bits of piping together- it seems not!Never ever use British Gas. They absolutely do not give a fig for customer service. You never see the same engineer twice, who knows its no skin of his nose if you are unhappy! Use a local company who care what you think of their service. Dont bother British Gas posting your generic response to this post. You try making the right noises in an attempt to redeem your reputation, it means nothing and I've heard it all before.k

1,"            I have been British Gas for years but after the mess they have put me in now I'm done forever.I tried to pay my quarterly bill online as I always do by credit card but it wouldn't authenticate my card at the end of the process so the payment didn't go through. I contacted my bank as it was a Santander authentication that went wrong and they said it wasn't an issue from their side it was the British Gas website where the problem was. I attempted to pay 5 more times but each time the screen went blank and I couldn't proceed. I got in touch with BG very slow email response and eventually got a useless response telling me I could pay over the phone. I didn't like the sound of that as the last time I contacted BG over the phone they continually phoned me up with marketing, abusing my ex directory number to sell me products without consent. I value my privacy a lot and this p*ssed me off.I kept getting reminder bills so I kept emailing informing British Gas saying that I cant pay on your website because it isn't working which they acknowledged but never addressed or fixed or attempted to. The reminders got more serious. I could pay bills on all other sites without problems using the same method so I assumed they would get round to fixing it soon.Now I have been passed onto a credit agency for the first time in my 50 years of being alive I have a bad credit rating thanks to BG for not listening to a single word I said, thanks for being really slow and useless to respond and thanks for never reading the emails or addressing one single thing. You are totally unhelpful morons who put yourself in this position by your failing systems and appalling communication and punished me for your shortcomings.I switch today and will never look back.

1,"            Absolute disgrace. It's been 9 months since we got charged for the wrong meter for an entire building rather than a single flat. How can it be so difficult for this company to sort this out and charge for the right meter? We were contacted on numerous occasions after being told by one colleague that it would be sorted and not to worry. She was going to sort it out and charge us only for the money that we owed. We then receive absolutely no information of the matter after being promised an email or phone call with the next few days. About 5 more staff members within this awful company then call us, demanding that we pay the money owed to them which is clearly not for the right meter. 5 more times we explain that it's been confirmed that it is the wrong meter and that it should be being sorted. Each time we were asked to give them our meter reading for the flat and the meter reading they keep incorrectly charging us for which is for the hallways etc of the building. Each time they assured us they would look into it and get back to us.. Except every time they get back to us they seemed completely clueless of the situation and conveniently didn't show anything on the records.9 months down the line we finally get a bill that seems to be genuinely for the correct meter. This involved a lot of emails, phone calls and chasing on our behalf to try and get because now we have to pay quite a few months worth of bills that we haven't had the correct access to which is obviously going to be a large sum of money. Surprisingly enough within days of receiving this bill we get some very aggressive phone calls demanding that we pay the full payment straight away as we haven't paid them anything. All of a sudden it's our fault that nothing's been paid?!  My partner, who I must say has been extremely polite and patient on the matter, after quite a few attempts to get through to British Gas sets up an agreement of a direct debit monthly with a bit extra each month than usual to try and clear the payments. YET AGAIN having to be the one to explain the situation over the phone because the gentlemen spoken too is completely unaware of what has been going on. This was in March that we make the 1st payment (6 months this has taken!).Anyway, we just received yet another phone call from British Gas. Turns out that the direct debit agreement we made hasn't been processed even though the first payment definitely came out. The member of staff we spoke to, after a few security questions, questions as to why we haven't paid two months worth of payments and insists we pay it straight away. Even after my partner briefly explains that he set up a direct debit, the guy very rudely and rather robotically  dismisses this and asks for the payment straight away. By this point we are both so fed up and frustrated at the situation we just read of our card details (again) and pay the amount without fuss. This guy then has the cheek to ask why it hasn't been paid but then cuts of my partner when he tries to respond! God knows what to expect next..We've tried complaining but have been given the wrong contact information. To be honest, I'm not even sure I trust the payments we are actually making now as everything has been dealt with so rudely and unprofessionally.Overall one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. We only have   3 months left in this flat, when I move I will most definitely not being using this joke of a provider. Absolutely furious.

After online chat british gas had someone else's name was on our address and said it was previous owners. I explained that is is impossible as our home was just built so we are first owners of the property. British gas then said they will set up a new account. Since then I have contacted them serveral times to pay for my correct elec and gas bill as have not heard back. I specifically asked for a manager who refused to talk to me and was told the current member of staff can deal with it. I was 6 weeks pregnant and the manage new this. I was very stresed and still manager refused to talk to me. From then on on british gas said they will sort it. I contacted british gas to explain my smart metre has suddenly not been working for a couple of weeks and is trying to connect. They don't seem to know what is going on and have not contacted me since. It is now 13th May  and I recieved another gas bill with incorrect account address on it.

2,"            We have subscribe to this service for many years. With central heating boiler cover we are paying in excess of £700 per annum.  Now we are in our 70's we appreciate have someone to carry out repairs that, in the past, I would have done.  We are in the process of having a new kitchen floor installed.  When the plinths under the units was removed it became apparent we had a water leak from the rear of the built in dishwasher.  Not to worry, it's covered by British Gas Homecare agreement.  Phoned them on Weds 3rd April, explained that the new floor could not be laid until the leak had been repaired and the floor dried out.  The earliest they could attend? Tues 9th!  It got so bad I ended up doing it myself.  Think it's about time I reviewed the contract and deleted some of the items, reducing the cost as it seems like I am unable to rely on this service.UPDATE. After carrying out the repairs myself, which included purchasing and fitting a new feed pipe, contacted British Gas to apprise them of this and to advise that the inline restricter valve to the dishwasher was not stopping the water flow to the machine.  Also, two further ones which should shut the hot and cold feed to the kitchen did not work, (they have not been used for years).   I informed them that had replace the hose, could they check it to make sure there were no leaks and reposition the unit properly.  Also, replace the three defective inline restrictor valves.  The operative said that this would not be a problem, in answer to my saying ""can you ensure he brings them with him"".  He informed me, he will carry them in his van.  You guessed it.  When the guy turned up, he said he only dealt with machines, changing the taps was a plumbers job and he did not carry these items in his van as stated!

1,"            Today,(8 May 2017) I received a letter from British Gas stating that 'Please Call us - there's a problem with your meter.  Your smart meter hasn't been sending your meter readings to us, so we need you to give us an up to date reading until we fix the problem.  I rang then to say that there isn't a problem with our meter as we check it every day.  They then said it wasn't a problem, but they would like us to go on a half hourly reading as we have the free electricity at the weekend.  I thought we had both the gas and electricity free on Saturdays.  I said no, as I don't know what the price will increase to if we go on the half hourly rate.  They then asked if everyone is in good health - what is this got to having a smart meter.  I pay over £25.00 per week.

I moved in with my partner, told British Gas that she was already with Sainsbury Energy, and as it was her property and utility company we would be staying with, I no longer required their services.  I told them to close my account and remunerate me the amount I had in credit.  Instead they took it upon themselves to close down my partner's account with Sainsbury Energy, a subsidiary of theirs, without her knowledge or consent, and transfer my partner's property into my name with them and continue to charge me.  No mention was made to my partner of the £200+ she had in credit with Sainsbury Energy.  I've been on the phone for over three hours, when I asked if someone could call me back rather than my waiting on hold while they conversed with each other, I was told ""that's not the way it works around here"".  They wouldn't even take my phone number to call me back and save me the cost of sitting on hold for hours while they tried to sort it.  By the way, I'm still sitting here on hold while writing this review!!!!!

1,"            How in this day and age can companies not follow the Data protection act?They used my information to try and sell me products, despite me putting on my account not to do so. They contacted me on an email address that I did not consent to (then claimed I had supplied it). They refused to acknowledge they used my data in this way, claiming it was within their rights to send 3 text messages, 2 letters, a email and phone several times, just to try and sell me their home protection! Even when you contact them to complain and put ""Email contact only"" they ALWAYS try to phone you (showing they do not follow data protection and the customer wishes).As far as the complaints go, THEY decide when the complaint is closed down, they don't try to resolve it with the customer, they just respond, shirk responsibility or trying to help the customer, then close it down so they can meet their targets.I dealt with two of their staff over this issue and neither one of the apologised for using my data in this way against my wishes, nor gave me the contact details of their head of service.They also claimed they gave me to Ombudsman contact information. Well the first one was the wrong ombudsman and the second didn't give me the information.If the apologised for using my data for sales and marketing, it would have been bad, but I would accept that mistakes are made. However, their blatant refusal to try to abide by the customer wishes is unacceptable!

2,"            I have mental health problems. British Gas sent me 3 Bill's for (electricity only) and for one quarter, all hundreds of pounds. I enquired and they rectified it and said the actual bill was under fifty pounds. I paid. This quarter they sent me a bill for over six hundred pounds!? Electricity only,  I'm in a 2 bed property. They did a metre accuracy test and deemed the meter to be working correctly and said the bill was correct and are now harassing me for the money. There's a shop up the road with 11 fridge freezers running 24/7 Slush machines lottery cash points etc the management said they'd never had a bill for that amount never mind a single man living alone. There's 20 apartments on my row nobody has had a bill for over £100 in a quarter yet I'm supposed to accept I've used over £600 in one quarter on electricity alone. I'm not happy I've been stressed and it's worsening my health problems and the management at British Gas said people pay that every quarter without batting an eye lid!? They appear to be blatantly trying to Rob me and I don't really know what to do about it but I will be seeking help and advice from my local MP and CAB at earliest convenience for them. I'm also going to see if I can change energy companies as I've totally lost trust in British Gas. I did get a bit loud on the phone and may have come across aggressively but I do have mental health problems and I'm vulnerable.  I feel like they are backing me into a corner with no way out but to pay this astronomical bill I cannot afford that they say the meter claims I've used. I was not using gas at the time hence why I only received an electricity bill. I was using an electric heater in one room to keep warm as I'd only just moved in and had nothing and was thinking if I didn't use the gas my Bill's would stay low and I could try and keep on top off them. So at the time I received this bill I was confined to one room for most of the time that room was the only room warm and I suffered in that quarter terribly because of this. Yet it cost me £600+. The heater I used was identical to the heater the engineer used on the accuracy test and he deemed the meter to be running low with that running so it's safe to say the heater never caused the bill. Yet the bill stands as no fault was found with the meter. This is literally beyond the joke now and I'm not a happy customer.

I raised two complaints only to receive a letter weeks later saying that they were glad they had resolved my complaints! I emailed back saying i'd heard nothing from them.  Just now I have been informed the complaints were shut down. Currently waiting for them to fix something they broke yesterday. Water gushing all over electrics.  I've told them what the part is but they can't communicate that to the engineer in advance. So no doubt it'll be ANOTHER day off work tomorrow. It seems they have no form of communications.  My monthly payment is a complete waste of money. The joke is they still haven't mended the issue that i first called them out for in January.... We are just fixing their botch-ups.  And, yes, they claimed they couldn't get parts which were fully available.  Complete cowboys.

I was told the engineer would be here between 1200 noon and 6.00pm. As today is very cold for this time of year, I phoned for an update on when I could expect the engineer to arrive. They have no idea.In this day of computers and mobile phones I find it incomprehensible that a company has no idea where their engineers are and what they are doing. Basically, I feel that they do not care about their customers.It's still cold and I am still waiting. No idea when someone will arrive.Only 2 and three quarters of an hour left until 6.00 o'clock.

I opt for the free electricity Saturday 9-5. but I will not get it free until the old meter has been changed to smart meters.during the sign up, I have managed to booked in a date for the engineer to change the old meter to a smart meter which is on April 25 from 8-12pm. I need to book an annual leave off work just to wait for the engineer-- around 10:30am on that day.. I have rung the customer department to ask if the engineer will arrive and they said that if my email says so.. they should arrived. I did not received any call from the engineer. at around 11:45am, I have logged-in online and had a chat with an online customer service in which she said that there's no booking for me on that day and no engineer showed up.I have rung the smart meter customer department and they said to wait for the engineer until 2pm-- i have waited until 6pm  but no luck.I have rung  the customer department again at 6pm and they said that there was no booking for engineer appointment for me so they have re-arranged an appointment and gave me a new date of appointment for the changing of the meter. May 2nd from 8-12pm they gave me. they have given me a reference number ##### for the complaint.again, i need to have the day-off today (may2nd)just to wait for the engineer and tough luck, they did not arrived to change the meter. I have rung the customer service and apparently the engineer did arrived early this morning around 9am but only to read the meter. I'am loosing my hair as I've been scratching and pulling it unnecessarily.I have all day last week on the initial appointment waiting for the engineer and today as well and they should just asked me to read the meter for them. in which by the way already done. I already have my last suppliers (edf) final bill.they gave another reference number ####### apparently it is a complain for the previous complaint that I have because I was not happy.and they give me another date for appointment May 18th from 12-5pm, this is getting exciting as they said to ring on the day to find out what time the engineer will come to me. fingers crossed.but to be honest I have lost interest  and render my decision to join britishgas as frustrating. I know the engineers are really busy and getting appointment is hard. but the incompetency of the customer service to handle appointments/complain is really infuriating. spending more than 40 minutes each time to call the customer services and still could not get the appointment done for me is a turn-off. I'm feeling hopeless.I have been with edf for countless years and never contacted them in any way whatsoever, I thought joining britishgas will be a wise decision but I was so wrong.------------------------------edit: I've been with britishgas now since May 2017 and happy customer. they are the cheapest that we have and we are on free saturday (9-5) use tariff.and the smart meter is the best out there.

After the 6 months, BG doubled the rates so I moved to Scottish power informing BG of my decision and the reason behind it. Its almost like a year since I have moved from BG and I am still chased for a few hundred pounds that I am unwilling to pay because of the commitment I received from their sales person. BG has not provided a copy of my conversation with their agent, I do not believe that they have even reviewed it themselves. Just a few weeks ago, one of BG representative confirmed that my calls will be listened to and I will be informed. Then another person asked me to contact her, I called and left my details but no one ever contacted me. And now I have received another letter from this  Pastdue credit solutions company for payment. It would be interesting to note that in the past, reps from these debt collectors and credit / financial solutions companies have listened to and agreed in favour of my arguments. BG has no legal right to pursue for this money where I had an agreement with their rep that I would not be charged for anything in the first 6 months other than a fixed monthly bill for gas & electricity. Just stay away from BG, their bullish and aggressive methods of harrassing customers in order to maximise profits are not just unacceptable but illegal, I believe. MuhammadB113HS

1,"            Annual service via our HomeCare plan fixed a problem with hot water, so far great. The engineer suggested Hive as a way of saving money - sounded helpful so agreed and 4 days it was installed. 48 hours later I'm trying to get hold of anyone at British Gas as I have no hot water, teenage kids and a warm weekend. I'm told Thursday is the earliest to get someone out to fix their work! I'm out working that day so it is Friday or day 6 before someone comes to hopefully restore hot water. The guys on the phone are apologetic, sympathetic and unable to do anything. I imagine if I was the CEO of British Gas we'd have hot water now or a credible reason why not. I'll keep the plan until you fix it and then look elsewhere, sell the shares I have in the company and deal with people who actually give a damn.Update: Reply from Sarah:Hi Mark, totally understand this is not the ideal situation for you and your family. Is the hot water issue resulting from the Hive installation or the central heating system please? Thanks Sarah. No email address provided to reply to???I'm pretty certain it's the central heating that was serviced on Monday 24 April 2017. The immersion heater doesn't work - is this meant to be checked? Cold showers for all and this has been ongoing for 3 days with another 3 days before an engineer comes. Not ideal? I'd drop the HomeCare label. if you did care then you would have arranged for someone to check pretty quickly why a service did not pick up, and fix a problem that happens the same week that the service took place. Pretty quickly was 24 hours ago.

1,"            I honestly do not know how British Gas are still allowed to trade. I have found out through my credit report that British Gas have applied defaults against me for every single month since 2013. They have never sent a bill. Never chased me for payment. Failed give the statutory notice of 2 weeks that they intend to notify the credit reference agencies. The worst thing is, is that they have admitted they didn't even supply me with at gas at that time. They said it resulted from a change in meter. But do you think that they have rectified the error and notified the CRAs as promised? No. I've emailed the CEO Mark Hodges and the Chairman of Centrica Richard Haythornthwaite, but still nothing. British Gas are fraudsters, their whole purpose is to ruin innocent people's lives.  I cannot get a mortgage and I have been declined credit purely for this. British Gas do not care. What they have done is illegal, but they appear to be above the law. Their customer handling is shocking. I have been told that everything I was told last week was a lie. I have been told no notes are on their system, no tasks to complete. I have spent hours and hours on the phone to them. Finally, I have sent them notice of legal proceedings, yet still. Nothing.Luckily, I am legally trained and will be able to commence civil proceedings myself. I will then commence criminal proceedings. But what about those who are not familiar with the law? Please , do not let British Gas ruin your life if you are a customer of theirs. You need to change energy supplier immediately.UPDATE: well. No update. Except further lies. 'I promise to call you back later today with an update at 3pm'. Well. More than 24 hours after that, still no call. British Gas will be held accountable for their lies, the lies which they have admitted to telling! All over the phone of course.

Called homecare, told appointment changed to afternoon call without notice. Called them again 5.45 told appointment cancelled, rebooked for afternoon call Friday. After waiting in another day, 6pm received call from engineer to say he was on his way. However he didn't arrive. Unbelievably, an engineer arrived at 11.10pm! Got the boiler working but said he really needed to see something outside to be sure all was working properly, but couldn't because it was dark. Boiler worked for 5 days, then broke down with same fault. Called Homecare but could only get an all day call next day.....so another day no heating or hot water.  Explained about previous call and needed to be during daylight. Was told notes of explanation added to the call together with request before 3pm. At 12.30 that day was told job was just being assigned and engineer would be couple of hours. At 2.40 following a very long talk with young man I was told it would be another couple of hours.  I asked to speak to a manager and I was told I couldn't speak to a manager as he hadn't seen one that day, and even if I did talk to a manager he couldn't do anything. At 4.15, I was told engineer just wrapping up a job and this call was next. He would be with me in 20 minutes or so. Within 3 minutes, a call was received to say CALL CANCELLED and no appointments available next day, would have to wait until Monday. Following a very lengthy discussion with a manager, I'm told a ""high level complaint has been raised"". However nothing to be done about a further 2 days without heating or hot water.  This has got to be the worst service and the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  The only people you can speak to have no authority over dispatch and you cannot speak to dispatch yourself and dispatch are the people who send the engineers out on calls. In other words,there is no recourse or course of action available to the customer other than make a complaint and wait up to 8 weeks for a bog standard "" we are sorry but do stay with us"" reply.Not sure why I am bothering to write this as reading their replies to other complaints on this page, British Gas clearly couldn't care less about their customer problems or lack of service. However, it may prevent someone from making the mistake of signing up to this company. I asked for contact details for the managing director and was told the managing director does not deal with complaints. Well maybe he should! It may lead to some improvements in their systems.Repair finally completed. Awaiting someone to contact me re complaint.

By 205pm no Engineer had arrived, so had to call again. After waiting on hold, spoke to a male operator who put me on hold while he tried to find out. He then told me that there were NO ENGINEERS AVAILABLE due to a high demand for emergency calls and did not know why no one had told me. Was told it could be rescheduled for another day. I explained I had taken TIME OFF WORK and this was not acceptable, especially after the first operator not having the COURTESY to call me back, and the second stating that the engineer had been DISPATCHED. After requesting to make a complaint and asking for the manager to be notified, I was told I could have a new slot between 2pm-6pm the same evening, so why was I told that there were no engineers available and only given this option after saying I would complain!

2,"            Moved to British Gas HomeCare after The AA Home Emergency made us wait 4 days to fix our central heating, and that was brought forward because we had a four week old baby. A sales person at British Gas said a baby would be classed as a vulnerable person and if we were their customer it would be fixed the same or next day. So we switched. Had our first boiler service with British Gas who said he could see daylight coming into the boiler from around a pipe so declared it unsafe and disabled it. He kindly left us with an electric heater (Thank-you) and arranged for another engineer to come and fix the problem. Because we were new to British Gas Homecare the work wouldn't be covered under the policy and we would need to pay, understandably. However, the next available appointment was in 9 days time. Our baby is now three months old so I rang HomeCare who were very nice and agreed that was too long to wait with a baby with no heating or hot water and said they would ring me back. He did ring me back the same day to say he will ring me first thing the next day, which he didn't. So I rang them again and was told they'll contact the local manger and ring me back, which they also haven't. We're still waiting in the cold regretting moving to British Gas Homecare.*UPDATE: I've had a call and now the wait has been moved from 9 days to 7 days.

My situation was an emergency at the time as we had no heating or hot water and young children in the house and thats why i called the British Gas ""emergency boiler repair"" service. After an hour on the phone and eventually getting through to a ""manager"" who would not log the complaint or do anything else to help other than book another appointment for 24hours later, I feel your attempt at trying to look sympathetic on this site is 2 months and 1 emergency situation too late Your still 1* I booked an emergency boiler repair in February and the earliest they could come was 24 hrs later with a 6 hour window .24 freezing hours later at the end of that 6 hour window no engineer had turned up. I phoned the centre to be told that the engineer had a more pressing emergency to attend and although I had a 4 year old in the house who could "" regulate her own temperature"" and that I needed to book again, another 24 hours later.There is no ownership of problems, no control and no apologies from British Gas. Guess what, no business from me ever.

1,"            Unfortunately not good. Pay for homecare plumbing and drains. Call out to fix a broken cystern. 1st visit  no part. 2nd visit incorret tool. Now worse than it was originally and we have had to tie up the ballcock to stop it overflowing.  That wasnt the original issue!. Promised a call back to confirm if someone can sort it before 3rd visit again on a day i have to take off work. Surprise - no call.  Not like this when there is a boiler or heating call out.  Very unhappy.  Have raised an official complaint.  First time ever i have had to call out on drains and plumbing cover.   Total waste of timesUpdateunfortunately my complaint has yet to be acknowledged.  The plumber has returned and work carried out so i have a working toilet.  Interestingly I spoke with the plumbers office on Saturday who confirmed their engineer was not booked which is at odds to the information given to me by BG.  I wonder if this was said as of course a weekend call out is more expensive.......Updatehi Jamie Lee.  How long does it take British Gas to acknowledge a complaint?

1,"            My first ever review. Driven to it. I'm one of these people now.Singularly the most appalling customer experience I have had in a very long time. One star seems too many. To recap.As a Homecare customer I scheduled my annual boiler service for 13th April. The boiler, admittedly elderly, had been functioning perfectly all winter and for several years prior to that.The service engineer arrived. Soon after he began his service it no longer functioned. He recommended another engineer but, of course, they might not be able to get the parts.....Following Tuesday, engineer arrived (no heat or hot water in the meantime, although, again, to be fair, I wasn't around over the Easter weekend). Boiler diagnosed as non-reparable. New boiler required. The fact that his colleague had broken the wretched thing, not relevant. Engineer left a voucher and strongly implied (read as misled) that this would ensure half price on boiler and installation. Also two years free Homecare, or should I say Home Destruction.Following Thursday (any sense of urgency from British Gas evident here?). New gentlemen arrived to price up boiler. Turns out his colleague was 'mistaken', half price only applies to the boiler and Homecare is for a year.Quote horrendous. Naturally. Rang British Gas. One call lasted one and a half hours. The process designed one felt to make one give up. Did I want to approve the installation, well yes, but I wanted some gesture of goodwill first. Eventually found my way back to Homecare who offered me £30, or less than one percent of the cost of the new boiler/installation. Declined, made a formal complaint, which, naturally, takes 28 days. But, of course, I require a new boiler so have to accept the horrendous quote fully aware of the ominous consequences. So when will my tiny flat have hot water and heat again? Well despite being encouraged to do so by the salesman, I can't claim to be 'vulnerable'. Tetchy certainly, but not 'vulnerable'. So May 8th. For those still here and not counting that's twenty five days of cold showers. I can't in all honesty say they were rude. But they certainly showed barely the slightest sign of concern. It's not at all like the adverts but that's Homecare.  Be warned.Jamie-Lee. Thank you for your offer. To where should I send these details?No reply from Jamie-Lee, after nearly two weeks. Lovely.

5,"            The service we received from the engineer that visited the property was excellent. However, we did receive a safety notice about a pipe (from the hot water tank) that is plastic rather than copper. We live in a new build property, that was only built last year and we have advised the building company of your findings/safety notice and we are now being told that the information that we received from British Gas was incorrect?

3,"            This service, to my Boiler and for the first time my Hob, seemed to take less time than just my boiler and was done inside of 1/2 an hour. Maybe this is normal, being a once a year occurrence but it did seem short.Also, in the past, the Engineer has allowed me to retain some privacy by requesting permission to enter bedrooms, and allowing me to check those radiators are working. Maybe I'm being paranoid as I was on nights and suffering from a lack of sleep, but this Engineer seemed a little too eager to stick his head in and comment.

1,"            British Gas failed to show for an appointment booked weeks in advnce.  Tried to say I was not at home (I was) and then made some claim the appointment was cancelled owing to an emergency - but then changed their mind again and said no one was home (untrue).  A no-show has happened before - I suspect the engineers are under pressure to make set number of calls and do this to 'create' space (they refused to tell us on the phone what really happened, so I can only guess). And it's almost impossible to get a complaint dealt with - you get transferred from pillar to post, and we were cut off at the point where the desk claimed to be willing to talk about compensation.  The offer of a weekend appointment made by one help desk was refused by the second (or was it the third?).  This contract was a waste of money, and this company is treating us with contempt.  We're taking our business elsewhere.

Previous years I've said meter in basement and no access and checks done and signed off.It's not my responsibility to arrange yearly checks and health and safety said you should work with your customers the landlord to arrange suitable times and dates. I phoned up complaining and got told been booked for 28th April 8 - 10 am which is useless for me I've got multiple health issues and dealing with idiots is becoming more common place. You need to make people aware and listen to feedback given your contracted to do the work and arranging dates etc not the tenant! Over the years the amount of people have been ripped off by British gas and getting others to do your job we should all send a yearly bill to you for our time. Even worse prey on the vulnerable people of society with excessive pressure and prices and trap people.Homecare ref below.Update 23rd April 2017Unbeknown to myself on Friday 21st April just gone 13:00 there was knocking on my flat door including constant phone calls had just woken up after having other tradesmen in previous days when answered the door a representative from the landlord and a British Gas Engineer were standing there my first reply was didn't know you were coming and let the engineer do his checks.It turns out speaking to your engineer he'd been arranging everything with my landlord and no one let me know as a whole I'm really unhappy about the whole experience and British Gas need to deal with the issue of gas meters in another tenants property located in the basement I'd strongly suggest stop getting the tenant to arrange appointments if this is an issue and deal with landlords or make landlords move gas meters into each flat as a horrible tenant could turn off the gas. The engineer was polite and knowledgeable being fair and issued an advisory and signed off. If I could remove the star I would and formally requesting a full investigation into this matter including why some engineers haven't worried as got a cut off handle in flat, additionally I'd like to know how you are going to remedy this now to myself the tenant for all inconveniences caused and what actions are you going to take to stop this happening again?I await your response.

The person on the phone re-books for first thing Tuesday morning, and gives a help/complaints number to ring. We try ringing that, but the department is closed over Easter. Monday afternoon, another call to say there's nobody coming on Tuesday either because the engineer is ill.  Who knew British gas only had one engineer? Massively let down, three appointments and three days wasted sitting around waiting for an engineer. We've had good things to say about British Gas in the past, but they've had a shocker this time.Update: British Gas re-booked promising someone would be out first thing Wednesday morning and have now told us they're not coming then either.

The fitter said that I would require a larger meter box which I would have to provide!  When I told him not to bother and go away, he explained that everyone will have to have one by 2020.  I suggested that I might wait untill they modernise and use `micro technology'.However, recently I applied again, and a young man attended my property. I explained that which had gone on previously and he took a look at the situation.  He agreed it would be tight...and awkward but...The installation took a little longer than scheduled but he completed the job without fuss and was a very nice and polite young man.

British Gas refused our request to leave them as we apparently owe £300 to them. Their website says they will agree a direct debit in these circumstances or a monly payment card if debts below £500, but when we phoned them they said no. We tried telling them that being on pre payment meter for 20+ years we shouldn't be in debt, but they say we are? Were now forced to stay with them till the debt is clear. Customers beware, British Gas don't stick to what they advertise on their own website.They don't tell you your in debt until it's to late for you to do anything about. Their answer is if over 28 days in debt they wont do it.? Surely at around 14-21 days they should inform you to give you the chance to correct the problem in time? My new supplier OVO is a small company and cannot afford to take on the debt. British Gas know this as we have explained to them. They still refused to help us even though we explained the cheaper fuel off OVO would  benefit us as were unemployed and have a disabled daughter who needs the heat on everyday. I haven't refused to pay the bill. I only ask they allow us to change supplier an set up a way to pay them back aswell. British Gas tell their customers to phone with any problems they have and they will do their best to help. Sadly this is not the case. It's  costing us more to stay with them and clear the bill than it would if we swopped supplier and payed the debt straight to British Gas.

They apologise and give an insulting 'sorry' (£50) for all my time and inconvenience. Yet again, this week another letter to say they do not know me and my account seems to be set up wrong (and they were the ones that confirmed my account when I opened it!). I cannot wait to get out of this contract and NEVER again will I use them - completely utterly appalled by their administration!

I phoned up about a leak in the toilet (on a Sunday morning) and they were out within 45 minutes and fixed a bad washer on the toilet. You can imagine the cost and hassle of sorting out a plumber if I had to do it myself, particularly on a Sunday.When I got my boiler serviced a couple of weeks ago, the man was out the following day to replace a pump. I even had a problem with the freezer and they were out the following day to replace the door hinges.I have their full package and it is expensive at fifty two pounds a month but it brings me peace of mind and I don't have to worry every time something goes wrong. It's money well spent and I know if something disasterous happens, as it did this morning, I have complete piece of mind.

2,"            Their Homecare cover is a joke. We've had them out to us on three separate occasions for three separate issues across the last couple of years and every time they have done the absolute bare minimum to correct the fault and left, despite a full repair/replacement being covered under the insurance T&C's. Not worth complaining to the FSO either because they seem to prefer protecting the company than helping the failed consumer.

2,"            Terrible experience. The initial surveyer agreed to put my towel rails on the primary circuit as I wanted towels to be dry even if the heating was off ie in the summer. The fitters decided not to do this but lied to me saying they had and waited for me to discover it for myself! When I brought this up with the installation manager he told me the fitters lied because they ""didn't want to get into an argument"" ! In addition since installation the pipes make a very loud banging every time the boiler fires up. I rang the same installation manager who said he was no longer responsible for my area but would email the current one. I asked to be copied into that email but he refused. He said I would get a phone call the next day from the new installation manager. That was a week ago, I'm still waiting and the pipes sound like they might explode when the boiler fires up!

I have been waiting for several weeks to get an item that we do not owe removed from Experian. (please see the the other reviews I have made)The Complaints handler named Philip Holgate, which I found out by phoning them has not even let me know that he is dealing with this complaint. I was told on the phone that I was sent an email to Richard@trustpilot  but unfortunately it is nowhere to be seen. I explained to a man called Sanjiv that that was not my email address.He tells me now that he is emailing Philip Holgate, so that in turn through another department that can email externally, he Philip Holgate, will let me know he is on the case.?! This has been going on for 8 weeks and still no resolve, no copy of a bill etc.The fact is that British Gas are useless when it comes to Complaints handling especially that they are not allowed to communicate a resolve via an external email system. This Company exists in the Stone age. I am no youngster but I am absolutely keeping up with technology all the time. British Gas how do you make any money?For goodness sake remove these items of the the credit files as they are not owed. We want compensation as well. What a horrible Company to deal with.

1,"            This company should not have the word 'British' in its name. I leased an industrial unit in 2015.  In 2016 BGas sent me bills for over £2300 for gas. Although there is a meter at the unit no appliances are using gas. It took me about 30 minutes to discard all the unnecessary paperwork and establish that each of the 22 bills were estimated, based on a meter reading in 2009. It then took 3 months and hours on the 'phone to get it resolved, meanwhile still receiving bills threatening late payment charges. Even though no gas is used I had to agree to a standing charge for the meter or pay to have their meter taken out! After refusing to accept a standard charge of 98p per day we eventually agreed 20p. Occasionally I have someone call me from India asking if the property is occupied or unoccupied and I do not see that I am obliged to answer that and will not. I have also had someone call to talk about payment one week after I had made payment. I asked 'is the balance of the account zero' the answer was yes! 'So why are you calling me?' The answer - it was a computer generated call!

I made the call on Wednesday 22nd of  March there earliest appointment was for Saturday 25th of March, but that wasn't suitable for me so i arranged for this Monday 27th March. The engineer arrived and within 15mins of examaning the boiler he was able to get the heating to work...Result!!! I was so happy I wanted to dance but then I remembered about the surgery I'd just had, so not a good idea. He advised that he would need to order a part but would be back the next day to fit and fix.He arrived as he said he would and was able to fit the part. This engineer was extremely professional pleasant and seemed as though he enjoyed his job and working for British Gas. He also gave advised on the new Hive system and on how I could add a timer to control my heating making my home  more energy efficient. The total cost for this repair was approximately £410, a good £109 cheeper than the ABLE GROUP whoop whoop! British Gas are constantly getting hammered in the press for bad customer service but  from the initial phone call I was treated with respect. British Gas deserves my 5* award.

When he found my other account, he didn't apologise. I've had several appointments booked at various times for servicing but there seems to be no record of these kept by British Gas. My most recent appointment was a call out to alter the water pressure on my boiler & the engineer said he might as well service it at the same time which is great but I'd rather have an appointment which British Gas kept (they cancelled one) than rely on the kindness of an engineer on a call. Recently, I booked (by phone) my  fire to be serviced on 24th April & was reminded by email that I need a service visit. When I replied to say I have an appointment booked, I was informed by email that British Gas don't have a record of this - I've made arrangements to have the afternoon off to accommodate this visit  so I've asked them to book a visit on this date.

Every time I have to use them for anything - even basic things like the annual service - something always goes wrong. When you phone up, people will say they'll phone you back - they never do, they'll tell you they'll do X,Y & Z to put things right but don't action their promises. Engineers don't turn up when they're suppose to, they say they'll phone before they come but don't or they get the address wrong & go to a different property. I've had engineers tell me my boiler is on it's last legs & that the replacement parts are no longer available & offered to arrange a quote for a new one, only to find out from an independent engineer that my boiler is fine (old but still ok & the parts are still available). I can't list all the issues & problems I've had with British Gas, as soon as there is an alternative company offering a comparable service product I'll leave British Gas & throw a party!

2,"            I use MSE to find the best deal for me taking into account price, service and reviews. Consequently I end up changing every year. The standard tariffs would be 2 to 3 hundred pounds a year more than I'm paying. I'm very cost conscious therefore I will always put price first and look at reviews. The suppliers should automatically put you/charge you according to the tariff which is best for you. But they don't. The Regulator needs to do something about this as collectively the public is paying billions of pounds over the odds. British Gas could give an end of year rebate if they could have paid less on a different tariff...

2,"            Very disappointed with British. First we could not get the shower working, engineer came on time next day. Found out the fault is with the shower itself and we are not covered for it.... Fair enough. Then on the same day our boiler was serviced by Kirk. That's where all started to be disastrous. After the boiler was serviced it was making a lot of noise the next day there was no hot water at all. We have young children it was so hard to jungle things around. Despite I suspect my boiler was working all fine till Kirk the engineer did something with it. Already frustrated since we had guest coming over we ask them if they can send someone to fix it suppose to be 24hrs service. FOR them this was not an emergency we were ask that they can get someone only the next day(not to mention the guy on the phone was trying to sell and upgrade to us seriously don't you think after failing to look after your customer we would want an upgrade with you I would rather tell my acquaintance to avoid you) . No option took a day off just to be told at the last minute that they have other emergencies they can't come but they will make sure someone comes tomorrow so another wasted for us. Gradually the heater has stopped working as well. JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!

1,"            I have been a customer of BG Homecare for coming up 15 years, just cancelled my direct debit as appalled at recent service.  I phoned to arrange my annual boiler service in November and was told they couldn't do it until 4th February as they had been very busy due to the extremely cold weather???  Wasn't that cold here in Bristol!  I've know much colder winters and always only had to wait a couple of weeks for a service so I complained.  My complaint hadn't been dealt with by the beginning of February so I complained again and was told they wouldn't be able to service my boiler until 27th March (today) so because BG hadn't dealt with my original complaint I actually had to wait even longer for the service than if I hadn't complained in the first place.Waited in all morning as service had been booked for today between 8.00 and 13.00.  at 12.00 I called Customer Service and was told that my call had been issued to an engineer and someone would be with me soon.  When no Engineer arrived I called the chap who had dealt with my complaint in February and who was the person who arranged the service for today.  He told me that the call had been cancelled 4 days after he arranged it but no-one let me know or him either, for that matter!  He said he couldn't understand why Customer Service had told me that it had been issued to an Engineer today, he thought the Customer Service Agent must have been lying in case I gave him a hard time!!!!I have cancelled my direct debit and as I haven't had to call BG out during this year's contract and, they clearly, cant uphold their end of the contract to provide an annual service, I have requested a full refund of all installments paid for this annual contract period.  They have refused to refund my installments which total over £300 and suggested a compensation amount of £120.00.  I have refused this as I feel they have not provided the service they say they can and have therefore broken the contract, meaning I should be entitled to a refund of all monies paid, not to even mention compensation!!!   They didn't seem to bothered about losing me as a customer, but they agreed their service had been disgraceful and suggested I take the matter to the Ombudsman which I shall do forthwith.

1,"            We had a water leak over our children's ceilings. We were asked whether it was from the central heating system or hot/cold water pipes. We didn't know. British Gas sent out Dyno (the plumbing side of British Gas) who visually looked at the ceilings, told us it was the central heating pipes, to keep the boiler off but ok for mains water to be on and they would be back in the morning. Next morning, my child switched her light on before we realised water was pouring out of the light switch and water was leaking above my other child's bed. We turned water and electrics off but water was still leaking down. We phoned up British Gas and were told it maybe several hours before they could get to us. We got a private plumber out who poked out the wet ceiling to reveal a pinhole water leak in the cold pipe (between jobs so they couldn't stay). British Gas man then appeared but he said he had to recall Dyno as it was a water pipe not a central heating pipe. Dyno man then came round and said it was an unsleeved pipe so we weren't covered. How do we know if our pipes hidden under the wall are sleeved or unsleeved? The house was built in 1996 and it was normal to fit pipes this way (apparently several years later they started to be sleeved according to a buildings reg company I know). We asked if he could do anything to help. He said he could cap the pipe but it wouldn't make any difference because of where the pipe was situated. I asked how is it we pay £33 a month and you can't even leave us with running water? He shrugged. We have had Homecare ( Central Heating and Plumbing) since 2000 and realise we have paid for a service that can't even leave our family with running water. Obviously we have had no working toilets, electrics in the bedrooms or water for 2 nights/ two days until we found an emergency plumber. British Gas have been worse than not having them. Due to their incompetence we now have more water damage in our house and potentially put our family in a dangerous situation.

Once again it wasn't possible to have the smart meter fitted and this time the excuse was something about the electrical device that is outside is not able to link with the home device or something like that?!Now I'm waiting for another call to book another day just to do this, hope soon.To be honest thing very well when you need to choose this kind of service and ask for another company's as well for quotes,Not happy in the end!

With half an hour left British Gas called to say that no engineer would be coming as they had been called out on a emergency call.  I asked, that surely a different team would deal with emergencies, but apparently not.  I was offered between 8 and 12 this Saturday, but I asked (Michael) is they could be more specific but apparently this wasn't possible.  I didn't want to wait around all morning.  I asked to speak to a Manager, and Michael said he would get someone to call me back.  They never did.  I then had to call Brit Gas back to get it arranged.  Very unimpressed.

BG sent an engineer (Adam) for 1st inspection under new contract, and I was told that the flue didn't have brackets to fix it in place so BG cannot provide insurance as it is risky.  Engineer from the last service inspection has mentioned the flue not supported but NOT unsafe and definitely NOT uninsurable. Utterly INCONSISTENT. After charging annually increased premium for years, BG now claimed it is not insurable and wiped off their history and responsibility of servicing them. Totally IRRESPONSIBLE. The cusomer helpline is also very unhelpful: impatient and impersonal. I explained the situation and the past history of insured and serviced by BG but she only reiterating the official line that BG has to terminate the contract because the engineer said it is at risk. Even when I suggested to  get the flue clamped (a simple easy task as suggested by the engineer) and book for a second inspection, she rejected with unhelpful tone and insisted I come back and start a new contract after get the flue fixed. Will I ever come back to British Gas? NEVER! CL

They'll still try and make the appointment same day as to not let you down totally, but I’m sorry in your situation it just hasn't worked. If you can email us at talktous@ with your account info and full address, we’ll chase up the £20 gesture of goodwill for you. Thanks, Nathan.

We have found some cracks on the wall and we asked a structural engeinner to check and find out the causes of it?. He advised  that it could be a blocked drainage and advised a check for the drainage system. As our British Gas insurance cover the drainage's system we called them and booked a drainage engineer appointment, however we had a call  from their engineer, Dyno advising that unless there  is a water flooding out side they wouldn't cover . When called British Gas to explain that the cracks  on the wall could be caused by a drainage  blockage although it is not necessary for the water to show on the surface. They did not agree and  their  customer service staff became  very argumentative and unhelpful at all.So do not trust their claim  and actually it is a waste of money .

Agent advised that I would get £10 sorry cheque in post.I advised agent:I may have a problem with either the thermostat or the boiler not sure which and if I need to call British Gas out, then I will between now and 4th May to rectifyI explained that Thermostat under warranty and because engineer was due out tomorrow, I was going to get the engineer to look at both for me and try and determine which was at fault - boiler or thermostat.However, now I will get the thermostat and receiver replaced next week but if the central heating is still playing up then I will need an engineer to look at the boiler before the annual service.I got the impression agent was relatively new - very polite and nice but not sure, so he kept talking to a 'Manager' but I could hear everything that was being said and when agent was talking to me, another whom he had been conferring with was was laughing and talking about me and the situation in the background or shouting at my agent what to do and say to me.

I said this several times to my agent and eventually he managed to mute his phone properly and the lady stopped and it went very quiet and my agent advised that she was not laughing at me etc etc.  I told him to please not lie for her as I had heard every word she said and would be complaining about her and the situation.my agent then said he would also put in a compliant and I would get a call from a manager within 48 hours - working hours.In the end, I got my agent to repeat back to me everything we had agreed and discussed:  I said it first and then made him repeat it back to me and confirm.Annual service booked on 4th of May£20 now being sent to say sorry for the inconvenience / situationA call from a manager within 48 working hoursA complaint about the 5 month delay in my annual service nowA complaint about the behaviour of the girl in the background laughing about my situation, mouthng off to others in the area about me and the situation my agent found himself in and making statements that an engineer would not come out etcI then asked my agent what I would be doing if I found that when I replaced the thermostat next week that the heating was still not working correctly.  He could not answer initially so I repeated the question and said I would be calling to make engineer appointment for boiler problem.  I got him to repeat this to me and ensured he understood.I asked for my agents surname, or ID and also the girl who was in the background but he said he could not give me them due to data protection, then said he did not know her and she was a colleague and not a manager.  I told him to stop lying for her and that I would be making a complaint about her behaviour as this was far from funny. I had wasted a day off work and now had a 5 months delay in boiler service and I paid £240 for this service which was appalling.my agent said he understood and he was very sorry but as I explained it was not his fault but I was not happy with the situation, the girl laughing and talking about me and mouthing off, then saying an engineer would not be coming - all of which I heard.After nearly 45 mins on the phone where in the end I got the agent  to repeat to me what he had done, what I was going to do and what was going to happen next, we hung up.This situation should never happen it is appalling, I pay a lot of money for a service I am just not getting

1,"            I have two gas/electricity accounts with Scottish Gas. Attempting to telephone this organisation is fraught, even for the most simple thing. Confusion reigns every time one calls, as each new respondent struggles to understand what has gone before: there is no continuity, least of all on the computer screens in front of them. Too many ridiculous misunderstandings to go into, but one's heart sinks if ever the need to contact them arises. The final straw is when one gets a complete stranger from abroad telephoning, demanding one identifies oneself by answering intimate questions and requiring that one deal with small estimated bills  immediately.I have other things to do in my life than to spend it dealing with moribund companies such as BG. I will be changing...but to whom, to whom?I have lost the will to live.....Furthermore, I do not respect organisations whose employees post responses under their first name only.... Jim. If you wish to speak to me, perhaps you could get in touch with me to discuss my posting, rather than the other way around. As it happens I have already spoken...at length...... with BG's complaints department, and put my point of view directly.

No one has directly checked that there was a gas or CO leak but all my gas been shut off any way, despite  the following - the boiler was checked by your engineer a couple of weeks ago, I have an up to date functioning co alarm that showed no indication of a leak, the national grid engineer did no checks, the boiler is only a couple of years old. I now am left in a house with a streaming cold and no heating, hot water or cooking facilities! Also horrified by the level of customer service delivered by argumentitive staff, in particular Sharon on Social media & imran on chat. Despite my request you refused to give me a fan heater, even in the circumstances. I understand from Sharon that your customer service staff have also made up details. As part of my complaint I would like all chat checked and my call listened to.

5,"            Thought i'd add a positive review after all the bad experiences people have written about on here.We'd been having some problems with our hot water supply, and presumed  the issue was with the boiler. Firstly we got a quote from a local heating company, who told us we had limescale and needed a new pump system in the boiler, which they could fix at a cost of £350+VAT, not including the £90+VAT call out charge we had to pay for the initial visit. Before we went ahead with the work we decided to get a second opinion from British Gas. Called them in the morning, and less than an hour later two BG engineers came round free of charge to have a look. After some tests they told us that the problem was not with the boiler, and everything was working well, but that it was probably an issue with the thermostat in the shower mixer. They said that there was no point paying for the descaling and new pump, as it wouldn't fix the issue.The two engineers were very knowledgable and helpful, and diagnosed the problem without charging us a penny. We later got a plumber out to look at the shower, and they confirmed the problem exactly as the BG engineers had said.I've had a few really bad experiences with British Gas in the past, and their customer service via phone can be a bit frustrating, but I can't fault this experience at all. Wouldn't hesitate to use them if we needed any other boiler work.

They then phoned me almost every 10 days to say nothing had happened and they were escalating the matter. If I was cynical I would say they were reading from a script.Last phone call they said they had actually done something towards resolving the matter and suggested i check my credit rating incase they had put a black mark against it. Made it sound like they were doing me a favour suggesting it!!Lots of telephone calls and finally an email to the CEO without a final esolution and it is now mid March.bg clearly don't care about resolving their mistakes and are either totally incompetent or really don't care at all

1,"            The shower on the first floor was leaking into the room below.A plumber visited on 3rd Jan and despite us removing the side panel of the shower tray for viewing, said there was nothing wrong with the plumbing and the sealant needed to be replaced.We replaced the sealant but before long the leak had recurred.Another plumber called and acknowledged that a part in the plumbing needed to be replaced and would need to be ordered.The appointment was booked for 17th February to replace the part. I stayed at home this day. I was told I would receive a call in the morning to be advised if the appointment was for a morning or afternoon slot. I had not received a call by 09:30 so phoned to enquire which time slot I was booked for. I was told that it was an all day slot. I explained that when I had booked the appointment I was told I would be given either a.m. or p.m. The person I spoke to said she would get the person dealing with appointments to call me to confirm the time slot. At 09:55 I received a call to advise that the part was not in so nobody would be visiting me that day. She said that the engineer was in the office the previous day and said that the wrong part had been delivered. Why was I not contacted on 16th Feb to advise that my appointment would be cancelled? Why was I not informed that the part was not in until I phoned on the day of the appointment?A new appointment was scheduled on 21st Feb, an all day appointment: 08:00 - 18:00. I was advised that the engineer would call to confirm his arrival time 20 minutes before hand. Once again I had to stay at home. At 17:45, I called to enquire when the engineer would arrive. I was advised that the part was not in and a message had been left to advise me of this. I did not receive any messages, nor did I have any missed calls on either my mobile or landline.A new appointment was made for 23rd Feb, between 16:00 and 18:00, as I was not able to take any further full day off and needed a more specific time. The engineer arrived as planned and successfully repaired the part.I have lost money through not working, in addition to paying British Gas for a service - a bad service!The fact that on two occasions I was not advised that an engineer would not be calling, demonstrates a shocking level of customer service.I received a text advising me to send a mail to customer service if I was not entirely satisfied with the service. I sent the text one week ago and have received no response to date.

2,"            Yes you get an engineer out quickly but as I came to realise they never actually fixed anything.  Over the last 4 years some of the issue I have had:1) Smelly drains?..Dynorod say just run a hot tap for a while - I didn't use to have to do this and have lived at the house for 10 years. 2) Shower backing up and water running away too slowly, not much they can do other than hoover the drain but nothing come out so we just have to stop in the middle of our shower and wait for it to drain away, they did say they to call them and they can come and hoover as often as I like but I suspect that frequent calls put your renewal price up.  3) Kitchen sink water draining very slowly and gurgling..they looked at it but it still does it. 4) Electric shocks when in bathroom, British Gas Electrician earthed everything, this did not resolve, it was clear we were getting no where so in the end I got an election in and paid to find the problem myself. 5) Heating flooring, not covered, but I had thought I had electrical cover but not the right type - not their fault but do read the small print and understand exactly what they cover.6) Rear drain blocked and backing up, Dynorod say it looks fine or is the down pipe (which is not covered0 ..it's not fine, Dynorod didn't even lift the drain cover, I expect because it was inconvenient to get to, it is still flooding when it rains so I have a drainage company coming out to fix it. At £800 per annum it is an expensive luxury for someone to come out quickly and reassure you that there is not anything wrong when you know there is. In summary get boiler cover with annual servicing if you do not have a good local heating engineer but I would not bother paying for the other services they offer. My experience is that if you use them the price goes up and up at renewal. I have now found excellent local trades people who are prepared to get to the bottom of each of these issues and funnily enough there is an issue with all these problems that did need to be fixed.

The first time my boiler was working but had a slow drip, the engineer came on a Friday morning and  took it apart and then realised it needed a part but it wouldn't be able to get it until the following Monday as I wasn't a ""vulnerable case"".  Please bear in mind I've been paying taxes for 30 years since finishing university so always have contributed to the ""vulnerable"" people in our society through paying high taxes so it was the wrong thing to say to me.  After a ""conversation"" with the engineer he arranged for it to be fixed the following day, it did make me wonder why I am paying them, I don't expect to have to get into dialogue when I'm paying for a service.Go forward 9 months, I booked an appointment for an engineer two weeks in advance due to work commitments and guess what I got a phone call on the day at 11.15am to say the engineer wouldn't be coming as my appointment had been given to a more ""vulnerable"" case, the slot I had booked two week previous had been between 8am and 1pm.I now have to book and see if they will turn up next time, I have lost total confidence in their business module and how they manage their resources, as soon as my contract expires I am moving on.The amount it has cost me to take time off work and then pay them at the same time I could just as easily paid for a plumber from the internet to come and fix my issue.I was a BG  gas supplier customer 20 years ago and moved my business due to their poor service at the time, it's reassuring that the world has changed so much in 20 years and BG are operating in exactly the same poor manner.

At 5pm I rang to confirm and they said the engineer was on his way. At 5:59 they rang to say they weren't coming and cancelled on us, after we had taken a whole day off work. They then rearranged for 2 days time at 11-1pm. They turned up 2 hours early and sent someone who was not an electrician.....to fix our ELECTRICITY problem. He couldn't do anything so we had to call AGAIN. We were then told an electrician would be over in 2 hours. No one showed up. We called again every hour asking and were told later and later times. (Again, another day off work wasted). We were then told they'd come latest by 10pm. No one showed up. They then said someone would come anytime from now til 6am - honestly a joke do they expect us to stay up all night for them?! They then had the cheek to say they knocked on our door twice - despite us being in the flat all day AND there being 2 codes to get into our building...After us chasing them up (they didn't even have the decency to tell us themselves that they weren't coming), we took the decision to not spend all night waiting for them to inevitably never turn up.This is by far the worst service I have ever received and given the choice I would cancel my services with British Gas immediately. There is terrible communication among the team, people accused us of lying, and no one seems to be helping us. It's a total joke and I would not recommend to anyone, unless you fancy wasting several days from work and wasting endless hours on the phone.

I told him how unhappy I was and that I’d taken time off, lost earnings and had to incur the expense of putting my dogs in kennels for today and tomorrow. 7.	At 12:20pm, a lady called from a call centre in India proposing the 13th and 14th March which is no good.

1,"            It took literally an hour on Friday on the phone to set up home care account and get an engineer appointment ( Aspect who we'd booked with the week before were a couple of minutes in comparison - unfortunately their engineer had to postpone so we thought to try British gas). The British Gas engineer turned up the next day as agreed but without texting to say he was on his way. He refused to repair boiler - which BG had said they would do as they said they were taking on the  contract. This had all been explicitly committed to by BG the previous day on the very long call. Their rationale was that the previous owner ( we had just bought the house) had a BG contract and they would take us on without a repair but just paying a £60 excess - which I paid over thrnphone.  I got BG on the line but he disputed with them. He said they had got it wrong committing to take on the contract, and said the previous owners had only had a service every other year not every year . It was clear he wasn't going to do what they had committed to do. And I said how useless he was and asked him to leave.He then hid around the corner and some time later , after my wife and I had left the house - in search of a warm coffee bar to call more gas engineers ! - our house was freezing - he called to notify a gas risk to National Grid . I got a call saying they were about to force entry with locksmith and police on way. No reason to do this - the boiler was switched off and indeed not working so no risk at all of carbon monoxide -  and indeed had been serviced only days beforehand by an aspect engineer. If i hadn't literally sprinted back to house the door would have been forced. The engineer possibly annoyed  that I said he was no use or resenting me calling the BG office,  or saying we had had an Aspect engine in earlier to service boiler, had decide to try and get our door forced. Unbelievable. We had only moved in the day before and as if a freezing house with no working boiler wasn't bad enough. We have made a complaint to BG . Presumably they committed a crime by falsely claiming a gas emergency and using the draconian powers thal allow forced entry _ and we are investigating this too. My advice - never ever ever even consider using BG, the others operators  are angels in comparison. I had been put off the the palaver with the long delays and long call when I first called BG after the boiler first broke , so I gave up on the call and instead got the Aspect engineer to come round - the only problem he couldn;t come back the next week to do the repairs due to illness( and it was urgent for us to get the boiler sorted as we were moving in) I made a big mistake then thinking to give BG another go. Don't do it. Never ever consider using British Gas.

The first i heard of this was a letter from a debt collector by the way, apparently they skipped the step where they contact me and give me the bill and just passed it straight to their debt collectors... i have contacted them several times to be spoken to like i'm some sort of simpleton and in the end to be told ""either prove the meter is faulty or pay it, otherwise we will take you to court"". I am speaking to the ombudsman, i did ask to speak to manager at british gas to be told ""they wont take your call, there isnt anything they can do you have to pay"".

1,"            I was a british gas home care customer until today. I had two engineers visit when my boiler was giving me problems and both told me my boiler was old and there were no spare parts available. They then quoted me over £3k to replace the boiler. I got a second opinion from a local plumber who said I didn't need to replace the boiler, I just needed the plate to plate replaced, something that is in stock and costs £100. I then got a further visit from an engineer who then went to buy the replacement part and the hot water is working better than ever. My complaint is that if any local tradesperson acted the way British Gas have, they would be branded and could potentially go out of business. British Gas get away with it. My other reason for the complaint is that their customer service teams do not know their own terms and conditions. I have phoned up three times to chase for a response to my initial complaint and was told it would take 28 days to respond, it has now been 31 days and having spoken to them today, I am told that my complaint has not even been assigned so no one is looking into it at all at the moment. Great customer service being shown that when engineers lie to customers it takes them more than a month to even look into it.

1,"            I had a smart meter installed in November 2016 worked fine until last Monday when on the monitor screen came up with a message to contact customer service if the problem persists . The problem was the house monitor lost contact with the mains meter even though it has not been switched off or moved from the day it was installed. British gas smart meter team members  do not have a clue, I have spoken to 4 people and each one has had a different answer to the problem . It  appears , as long as the mains unit is sending a reading to them and its not over a excessive time frame in their opinion,  there is no problem. Even though one person had arranged for an engineer to call and check the monitor and mains sender unit. Within one hour I was called back to say the appointment would be cancelled as it was not the monitor at fault and they would wait to see if  the monitor would reset itself. In the mean time they would monitor my account to see if the sender unit was sending updated readings and they would contact me once they have established the mains sender unit was working satisfactorily. I had the smart meter installed so I could monitor my energy use , I am being prevented from doing so due to poor customer service from the smart meter team at British gas.    Seriously thinking of changing my energy provider.

1,"            I've never written a review in my life, so it's a shame I have had to write a negative one. I will make sure that I do not write based on my current emotions (although quite difficult).Summary:British gas were supposed to do two things at my flat last month, my husband stayed back from work to grant them access to the property. They did one but 'forgot' to do the other (there's still a discrepancy as to whether they forgot to do it or the landlord did not book it - although the landlord said they did).They then said that they had to come back again to complete what they should have done the first time. We all make mistakes so, technically, this was fine - as long as they were accommodating and flexible, right? This is where the problem began. British Gas were extremely stubborn, refusing to give out of hours service or a shorter time slot. As my husband took the last Friday off, it was unfair for him to take another day off so I did. As usual, British gas took a while in coming; granted they had other jobs, I go back to my first argument - if they did not make the initial 'mistake' we would not have had to rearrange; time would not have been the issue.As a result of staying home, I lost over £200 (supported by a letter from my work place). When I spoke to the team at British gas, although very friendly and polite in their defence, they really did not help. One of their responses was 'we do not reimburse people for a day's work...some people earn £7/hr, others £100/hr. Till now I find this response irrelevant and insensitive.They offered a 'goodwill' gesture of £50 but again, this is no where near any compensation for what I have actually lost out on. I will not stop here. I hope this review has helped someone!

1,"            Don't even know where to start with this.Arranged a monthly payment of £20 per month.Needed a gas safety certificate so thought it would save me some money in the long run and would get boiler checked..... couldn't get an appointment for 11 weeks!!!!  and then the guy didn't even ring the doorbell but just put a card through the door. Very annoying after taking time off to sit there for 6 hours (afternoon appt. is 12 to 6pm).after complaining got a 2 week appointment and again someone waited 12 till 6 and then had to leave for work ... and the engineer put a card through the door at 7pm. Didn't even call me to explain as I could have got someone else there. Tried to get a third appointment - they gave me a 2 hour slot which they said they would confirm and write me an email to confirm and call me to check if I could get someone there that day. I couldn't get anyone but they never confirmed or called and I didn't know if they were going or not. Then had a voicemail  to say engineer was  on their way in half an hour.... tried to call them back but number was private so couldn't do anything about it and I wasn't prepared to call them to sit on the phone for half an hour..... SO FRUSTRATING.In the meantime had an emergency one evening at 7pm and waited 1 HOUR !! for them to answer the phone while water was coming through the ceiling....had to pay £60 for call out and when someone eventually came out  3 hours later they said the policy didn't covers showers even though the leak was from internal pipes in the wall.  He said his manager would quote me for the part and the labour would be £140 an hour (Minimum charge £140) but I never heard from anyone again even though I left his manager a voicemail message. so i had to get another plumber out and pay.Then there was a blocked loo...... guy said that all the flushes in the house needed changing and to call dynorod plumbers and we would have to pay (when the private plumber came to sort the shower he said that was rubbish).Complained several times during phone calls and online but never had any response.Eventually called customer service and after having the policy for over 4 months they agreed to give me a refund for everything I paid plus £60 compensation.British gas doesn't have enough people they can use and the ones that do use just don't seem to care. British Gas also does not employ enough staff to deal with calls - waiting an hour in an emergency was one of the most stressful situations. We actually had 3 phones on the go and were calling other numbers we found online - a second line answered after 40 minutes.So never did manage to get the boiler serviced - after I cancelled the contract I got a local plumber to service the boiler, and do gas cert. for £100 and he even fixed a leak while he was there and didn't charge me. He came the day after I called him and gave an precise time and came exactly on time. That's the way it should be.I thought that having the contract would give me peace of mind but I felt like I had aged 10 years in those 4 months - so stressful !phew... I do feel better for that :)

1,"            Due to the experience received from a so called 'reputable' company, I felt compelled to leave my comments to make people aware.I booked an annual service for my boiler. I picked a day (Friday) and time slot (8am to 1pm). I took the day off work.After waiting until half 1 where I had not received any contact, I took it upon myself to call them. After holding for 20 mins, I spoke to an advisor who apologied for the delay and promised to call me back in half an hour.  I did not receive this call back.  I gave it a couple of hours as I suspected they were quite busy.After calling back I was advised by someone that the engineer would not be coming out and the previous advisor had not left any notes on the system! The advisor stated they had rearranged it for the following Monday. To which I replied that I have to go to work so how can you take it upon yourself (i.e. the company) to rearrange it for another day without consulting me. I had to agree to this date as there were no appointments until March and a family member kindly offered to let them in. I was put on hold again and told that the time slot for Monday had been taken and they could not arrange another service until March. This was simply the last straw so I decided to cancel and ask for a refund so I was put through to another department. The lady I spoke to in order to cancel the service was very professional and sympathetic. It is quite ironic that the best service received was at this point. I was offered £10.00 compensation which I found rather insulting given the whole rigmarole.I apologise for rambling on. In short, I will never think about returning to British Gas. If you are unable to deal with the demand, just be honest and keep your customers updated. Communication is vital.

About an hour later received a call from the engineer who said he didn't have time to get out to us and rebook.we then received a letter telling us a service was due and to book an appointment. Boiler serviced on Monday. Broke down Tuesday- restarted but then broke down again Wednesday and wouldn't restart and was also leaking water. Another engineer came today ( Friday) and said the condensate trap was full and overflowing. When we questioned whether this should have been checked during the service today's engineer said ""well it was obvious it was full"" shrugged his shoulders and said he couldn't comment any further. The service we have received for a service we pay for has been in our opinion dreadful and welcome your response.

The boiler hasn't completely broken down yet but it will do soon with no pressure and I thought ""looking after your world"" included preventative measures like fixing boilers in a timely fashion so that they don't completely breakdown.Hi Sarah it was a repair and a service and it has now been completed thankfully but at the fourth time of asking which isn't really acceptable.

1,"            i was browsing the net and found out british gas did a homeware plan. i read about it and frankly i was well impressed. for £16.50 a month i would get a free service every year on my boiler which is only 1 year old and in the event there was a problem with my plumbing or heating british gas will come and fix it for only a £60 excess. well what a brilliant deal and i quickly grabbed the deal and bought the homeware service and booked my first service visit.The engineer came on time for the boiler service within the time slot i was given and i even received a phone call saying the engineer was outside and he carried out his service and everything was good i was surely well impressed.two days later we noticed water was leaking from the boiler and this was definitely not there before the so called service was carried out by british gas. so i phoned up british gas to report the fault and said i'm not saying the engineer made a mistake may be it could be a fault developed with the boiler itself but nevertheless it needed to get fixed as the water is leaking on the worktop and could potentially damage the work top. but as we now have the homeware cover i had nothing to worry about.so we were on the wednesday 2 days after the boiler service i phoned up british gas and reported the fault. I was a priority booking and its an uncontrollable water leak and the first available booking was on the following monday i wasn't too happy about waiting that long but that was the first appointment for a priority and had no choice but to accept it. the appointment was between 8am-10am.come monday i didn't go to work in the morning and waited for the engineer as i am self employed i moved my work to later but come 11am when no-one turned up i had to go work got home at 9pm rang up british gas line were closed.tuesday morning rang british gas at 8;30 am and explained the situation and the guy on the other end of the phone even agreed that this was unacceptable and the mater would get sorted and he will have an engineer with us by 1pm and once again didn't go work and waited till 1pm again no sign of british gas.. so i went to work .. today wednesday 10 days after the british gas service i phoned again in the morning at 8.30am and not i was classed as an emergency and i was guaranteed a visit today again no-one showed up. i just phoned british gas and now its 8.20 pm and guess what i was told an engineer will be with us today itself between now and 7am. so according to the nice people who work at british gas i am meant to stay up all night waiting for the engineer to turn up who probably won't bother coming anyway but they can't guarantee it in writing by email or text msg as they only make bookings and cannot send email. well once again i have no choice but to take there word for it.come 7 am tomorrow mr and mrs british gas if no-one has turned up i will contact a solicitor and we will see what is going to happen and i will definitely cancel the so called homecare service as obviously it is a waste of time and money as when there is a problem it is not an emergency for the good people who works for british gas. they will waste ur time make you wait around while they make fake bookings to give you hope but in fact nothing is getting done.my advise is keep your monthly payment saved up ready for when there is a problem contact an independent company and you pay them they will come and service or fix your plumbing during the time slot they say they will. not companies like british gas who loves taking your money but when it comes to giving you the service you paying for there is no sign of them.deadline is 7am tomorrow morning british gas and i will take no apologies for an excuse. i want this issue sorted and we will discuss compensation for all the inconvenience caused and moneys lost due to making me waiting around for your good engineer to turn up...

This soon changed. On the day, I was up from 7.30 to make sure I was up and ready. I sat reading a book and at 10.30 still not received s call but this is fine because they had given me a time of 8-12. It was then I noticed a card through the door, no knock and no phone call. I booked the day off work especially but after calling them and them saying an engineer wouldn't be coming I went back to work for the afternoon so I didn't waste the whole day. Eventually I spoke to a manager and he agreed it was their fault and said he would review the good will guesture they offered but had to clear it and would phone me back. Next day he phoned back and couldn't give me the amount discussed. He also changed his story. All I wanted was a fair amount for the morning I had lost. I have since asked for a subject data request and still not had acknowledgement of this or a response. I certainly will be rethinking my energy provider to go with a cheaper one with better customer service, also affected how I feel about the other British Gas products/services I have....home insurance, home care service etcOverall rubbish service and not the first time.

1,"            You will see that British Gas responded to the following review, asking for details, which I supplied. So well done, TrustPilot for being a channel which seems to draw attention to customer problems.The eventual response from BG, which is not visible below, was along the lines of ""All your conversations with us  were recorded but the operators did not cross-check with what had happened before."" I do not find that particularly reassuring. Their answer went on to say that they would smooth the process of getting the customer's account set up properly with the appropriate meters. BINGO! There's now a letter with their customer saying they want evidence of her income, despite the 40 years impeccable payment history she already has with them. These people REALLY care, folks.The reply may have been politely worded, but it does nothing to escalate the resolution of their organisational problems that I highlighted in my original review, which you will find immediately below:_________________________________________________________British Gas is an awful organisation, despite the competence of some of the individuals who work for it. You would think that they were totally new to the energy supply industry, instead of being such a famous name. Every time you contact them, it is as though they are dealing with a fresh problem—the lights are on at the call-centre somewhere, but there is no record of what has gone before. They give no indication of cancelled appointments, although they make threatening noises about how you must be in yourself to greet them. The records they keep of meters on the premises they supply can be woefully inaccurate and out of date. I would never recommend BG to anyone after my recent experiences. They seem content to allow supplies to be cut off to a frail customer in the middle of winter, all without apology or any offer of recompense.I have been helping a lady with mobility problems in her takeover of the tenancy of a flat. As a previous customer of BG with a 40-year history, she arranged to switch her electricity and gas supplies to BG, and they accepted her as a customer at the new premises. BG did this without checking that they could actually supply energy to the flat, where the previous tenant had used a PayAsYouGo supplier with a card-operated meter for gas. In effect, BG allowed her supply to be cut off during the coldest part of the winter to date because when the credit ran out, they stated that they could not operate with that style of meter and would need to send an engineer to change it. “In this particular instance”, they condescendingly said—as though it was her fault that they could not fulfil the contract—they would treat the problem as an emergency and there would be an engineer there before 8 pm that day. No-one turned up, and no warning was given that the appointment was postponed or cancelled. On calling the help-line again the next day, it was all treated as though it was a new problem and as though they had never had any contact with us before, and as though no visit had been scheduled—it all had to be explained all over again. Fortunately, I had arranged for the loan of some electric room heaters.This time, an engineer did turn up promptly, and the individual himself performed faultlessly, showing great concern for the customer. However, without his urging, his bosses would have treated their customer as a totally new connection and done credit checks that could take up to 30 days before agreeing to install a credit meter. In the meantime, she would have had to kneel on her arthritic joints on the pavement outside the flat to feed a plastic card into a meter semi-concealed below ground. Fortunately, that proved to be a potential nightmare rather than the reality, just because an individual gas fitter was thoughtful, against the preferences of his employing organisation. The fitter left details of the meter changes he had made, for both gas and electricity and said that the records would be updated. No problem, you might think.The next event was the arrival of a BG prepayment card days after the meter change, posted to her at the flat. You must wonder how she was supposed to be paying for her gas during the intervening period. After a one-hour phone call to the “help” line, protesting that this was not what had been arranged, the phone call was terminated by BG, with their faithful customer feeling that she had been given the run-around just to get her off the phone. So I called myself, thus starting yet another enquiry that, so far as BG was concerned, seemed to bear no relation to anything that had happened before at the premises. I had to explain all over again about the change of equipment to a credit meter, and was eventually obliged to go outside to read the serial number of the meter, and the current and previous readings, to relay down the telephone. I offered to read the details of the schedule of equipment and meter readings left behind by the fitter but that was of no interest. It will apparently take the organisation another 5 days to deal with the accounts problem they have created for themselves and their customer.What is truly amazing is that BG had apparently recognised the change of electricity meter, evidenced by the fact that they did not want me to provide those details, but as for providing a gas supply, we might as well have been in La-La Land. Yet those meter changes were clearly all on the same paperwork, the same sheet of paper, even. Their right hand so clearly neither knows nor cares what their left hand is doing, and they clearly keep no record of events. They are an accident not only waiting to happen, but seeming to make them happen every day. They refer to this metering team as ""Smart""!“Thank you for calling the British Gas Customer Helpline. Is there anything else I can help you with today?” No thanks, I’d rather be dealing with a proper supplier.

1,"            Dear Sir or Madam,I moved into my new flat 07/06/16. I later received a gas bill for £214.17 up to October. (Both the start and finish numbers were estimated;. I am a single person living in a well-insulated 2 bed flat, and the bill was for summer months when the only gas I used was for my daily shower. This equates to £3.1 per shower! ) The bill related to the wrong meter number. The bill related to meter no. **********1201. My meter, later confirmed by the developers is **********0801. I have reported this to you by phone (14 times) and by letter and email. I have spoken to many people including Tom, Dale, and Rebecca at Complaints. All have promised to sort this out. Rebecca managed to get your admin charge for late payment; removed from my account, and said that the metering team would be in touch. All that has happened is that you have sent me another bill, welcoming me to my new address, (Flat 2 ******* ****** Villa) WRONG!!. I am quite happy to pay my bill for the gas I have used, but not someone else's estimated bill. In addition I have just discovered that I have run up a substantial phone bill (about £60, I think) in these endless phone calls, because I had to use my mobile phone, my home phone not having been connected until recently. I am on the phone to you now, was connected quickly but have been waiting now for another 28 minutes for the young man on the other end to find my file. ( The call was finally 57 minutes) While waiting I have just noticed that the Personal Projection you have assigned to me is an outrageous £2013.54 per annum, but the projection you give for Flat 2 is £354.18!!!! Both flats of a similar size, both with new condensing boilers, using gas only for central heating and hot water. The only difference being that I am sole occupant.I read my meter on Dec 1st. On 01/12/16-my meter read 6855. On 31/12/16 it read 6982, so I used 101.85 unit= 0.33 per day IN WINTER!Please can we start at the beginning, with the right meter, the right address, and the right personal projection. Paul at the moving home team has been most helpful, and has told me someone will be in touch;. This happened between 07/06/16 and January 4th, 2017. No one has been in touch.Please can we start at the beginning, with the right meter, the right address, and the right personal projection. So I can pay the right bill, and get moved onto the right tariff!.Now today, 07/02/17I still have no resolution to my complaint, (I am now 7 days until my complaint is escalated with Resolver) and today I have received a bill for £941.04, with a personal projection for gas only of £1570.11, as well as a letter from ""Arvato"" informing me that they will visit me to discuss ""my outstanding debt"". You have still not registered me at this address, nor are you charging me for the correct meter. No one has been in touch with me as promised.As a retired lady and sole occupant of this new 2 bed flat I am finding the stress of trying to deal with a large company like yourselves, hard to take! I am quite happy to pay MY bill, not someone else's!Yours faithfullyDelia Forester

1,"            6/02/17.  I pay their very high rates for a service contract, which states  ""We'll be in touch when your next (annual) service is due.""  My last service was 7th October 2015.  Nobody has been in touch with me. The boiler has broken down and British Gas want me to pay the £50 excess despite their failure to keep their side of the arrangement.  I have been told variously that they don't notify the customer any more, it's my responsibility to contact them for the service, and annual doesn't actually mean annual, it means within a service contract period (ie could be a day short of 2 years apart).  So for while the rest of the worls ""Annual means once every 12 months, for British Gas it could mean once every 23.9 months. Dishonest and expensive.  Avoid.7/2/17  Hi Jamie.  Is October one of the busiest months?  If so why not come in September?  Also, you should not promise annual if you cannot deliver.  Finally, when you fail so badly on customer service you could offer to waive the excess on a call-out, due probably to the lack of promised service. Ashley

1,"            Just this moment completed a customer survey via the telephone after British Gas called me. I gave them a Zero because they could not give me an initial survey for 2 months after signing up on a home care plan. Guess what ? A telephone announcement at the end to tell me that because of technical difficulties my survey wasn't excepted.Not looking good for future service with British Gas.Just had a response from British Gas about being cut off when giving them zero ratings for customer service on their call back. Gave a completely unrelated answer about breakdown priority. If they were serious about a response why no opportunity to give a zero rating. Has anyone else had experience of being cut off when giving them a poor rating ? Could be a featured watchdog programme for the future.

1,"            I have had a terrible experience with British Gas. One of the bulbs in my tenants property was not working. A BG engineer came in and gave a quote for over £1000 to refit the bulbs and other wiring. The engineer also did not put everything back the way it was, when he left. When I called the BG customer care, they mentioned that it does not fall under the policy as it is a refitting rather than a repair work. I got another electrician (non British Gas) to take a look and he was able to repair the bulb, fixture and charged me a tiny fraction of what BG was quoting me. I did not even receive a response to the complaint I raised with BG, other than the bog standard we are looking into it for you. I paid the £50 call out charge, spent time making sure someone was there when the engineer went onsite, and then subsequently had to take time out of the day to take another electrician to fix the issue. I am now cancelling my insurance with BG after the horrendous experience I have had with them.

1,"            I called BG for a boiler service as I thought either my boiler or radiator was getting abit noisy, I was told they wouldn't service my boiler because it needed repairing and they needed to send an engineer to repair it before servicing, ok fine. When can they come? Monday to Friday and no evening or weekends was the reply ,so for somebody who works full time this is less than ideal. Very disappointed and had to make alternative arrangements with another company who caters for people who work.If BG had engineers that work weekends I am sure this would benefit everyone , Ps I am not interested in any cover I just wanted a one off repair and service .

1,"            We pay hundreds of pounds every year to BG Homecare Service and frankly I wonder why?We found a leak from a pipe in our kitchen yesterday afternoon. we called BG and someone finally arrived at 10pm.  He said he did not have the necessary tools to fix a pipe leak (wonder what tools, if any, he did have). He told us someone would call between 8 and 9.00 am this morning to arrange for the leak to be fixed today. Our water has had to be switched off at the mains so no fresh water, no baths or showers and no toilets.Of course, no one called.  I took today off work and so have lost a days pay. We tried to ring BG and finally my husband was told no plumber could come until next Monday at the earliest.  We explained we had no water but to no avail. They say they aim to get your leak fixed within 24 hours but we shall be without water for 5 days!!What is the point of insurance if they can leave you for days without water and now I'll lose another days pay?  It would be quicker, easier, cheaper and more convenient to just employ a local plumber when you need one which is what I'll have to do as I can't afford another day off work!I would never recommend this policy, it is a waste of money.I shall however be claiming the cost back from BG.

1,"            We have been a Homecare customer of BG for 18 months, and unfortunately the service we have received over our most recent heating issue is completely unacceptable. We called them out because a number of radiators were not working and the house was very cold. The engineer came out an evaluated and decided he did not have the correct parts so said he would order them and booked another appointment for later that week. He then came to do the work and found he did not have the right equipment to do it so booked yet another appointment for the following week. He then came out to do the work for the 3rd time and managed to change the pump that needed changing. He then left saying the system ""was not quite right but improving"" and said to leave the rads upstairs off for a number of days and then turn them on. When we did this the rads downstairs stopped working again, in fact it was worse than before! This was all during extreme cold weather. We then rang to get them to come out again for the 4th time to fix it and they tried to offer us an appointment 8 days away! I stated I was unhappy with this as it was an  unresolved previous issue that they were uncompetent about fixing initially and they then gave us an appointment a week later, still much too long a wait. However the girl on the phone kept saying the system wasn't working to make the appointment and putting me on hold, so it took 30 minutes to ""book"" this appointment. Then today they never turned up for the appointment even though my husband took a day off work,and when he rang them the girl had never booked the appointment. They refused to send anyone out today so I now need to take another day off work tomorrow for the appointment. All in all in has been a comedy of errors and appallingly poor service from start to finish. I will be moving both my Homecare and my energy away from British Gas ASAP and would NEVER recommend them. Absolutely dreadful.

I decided I would not commit to a service plan until I had experienced the boiler service. THANK GOODNESS I DID! My appointment for 7th Dec '16 was cancelled with a days notice, they re-booked it and I had to wait for another 2 months. They were due today but just got a call to say they can't make it and will re-book it again - They might now come in March. I won't hold my breath and I won't be taking out a service plan.

1,"            Having challenged British Gas about their 30% increase my annual Homecare premium (an annual event), I managed to get this reduced only by quoting two of their competitors very competitive prices for the same service.So all good so far however, I have experienced further disappointment from British Gas in connection with my annual service which I booked in November (for the first available appointment which I was told would be in January 2017).  Having waited in during the allocated time slot for the engineer to arrive, I received a call from him 15 minutes before the  time slot expired,  he explained he wouldn't make it to carry out the service as he was ""at a meeting"" but HE would be available to do so as his first appointment the next working day. Yes you've guessed correctly, another no show.  Not even a call this time.As I had the engineer's phone number I phoned him to find out what was going on.  His explanation was that ""he had passed it on"" and it wasn't his responsibility!I phoned British Gas Customer Service who despite investigating the situation couldn't explain why the second engineer didn't turn up but were reasonably helpful in (hopefully) arranging, for a third attempt,  the boiler service.I don't really believe British Gas fully appreciates the inconvenience and actual costs customers incur from their poor service.  Surely British Gas can do better, can't they?

2,"            Yesterday, 29/01/17 I called BG about 9.07am.  I was told an engineer will be out between 'now & 1pm'. An engineer called later to advise he had to reschedule to the afternoon appt after 1pm due to other urgent work.  After 6pm still no engineer, no phone call.  Called Service desk and was told someone will come out between now & 10am, no engineer turned up.  My daughter had to take my Granddaughter home.  House was cold. couldn't wake up. Called 9.38am, was told engineer would come out between now and 1pm.  Had to cancel taking my daughter to Uni this morning.  12:20pm. Found a 'missed you...' card from BG in my letter box, dated 29/01/17, time 1.33pm.  My daughter, son & I were in the house this am 29/01/1.  I left the house with my son 11:44am. There was no card.  I called BG 12.25 to say the card was left but no one rang the 'Bell or knocked the door or called my mobile like they usually do and my daughter was looking out for the. I was advised that the appointment was for pm not am. I told her this was not what I was told. Either way the time the engineer left was dishonest.  More over, the Service Manager seemed to be making excuses for the engineer and the service instead of apologising.  However, only the  service lady I spoke to this an 9:28 was very apologectic.  I've now been told someone will come out between the last phone call and 6pm with no apology just excuses. Last year BG engineers came out more than 15 times and I'm still having problems. As a result my stairway wall was soaked through the bricks from outside in due to overflow constantly leaking which was fixed after several months due to a faulty expansion tank I believe. It's going to cost me appreciate £1200 to redecorate my hallway.  Something tells me I my have to look at an alternative service, one I could trust

I had to take the afternoon off work to cover the 12pm-6pm slot, to be rung at 12.01 by the call centre informing me that the appointment would need rescheduling as they had booked an engineer that wasn't trained to do the job.The next available appointment is for Tuesday - 9 Days after the breakdown and another day which I will have to use holiday.In this day and age I'm appalled by the lack of organisation - I had to state on the appointment that the fridge freezer had broken down and this is already registered as a Beko model; why wouldnt an engineer be sent with experience and parts, saving them expense in the first place?Truly Regretting my decision to move to British Gas - I'll be looking for a replacement service provider this weekend

It is the luck of the draw if you get a decent engineer or not. however, as mentioned i moved to homeserve and it is just the same.  if only there was someone out there ready to take on this lucrative market and give a proper service. but i guess this is the same in many place. well I have a dream....

I was told that unless I set up a direct debit and paid in advance I had to go into a contract (but one I could leave anytime) even after telling the man on the phone I literally would be with them for three weeks and I just wanted to get the bill and not deal with them he still tried to sell me different deals and then a few weeks later I get a note from Experian saying my credit score had dropped because I had opened new credit accounts. Not one but two! One for gas and a separate one for electricity, this has dropped my credit score by 200 points and will affect my future credit for at least a year. I could not have been clearer with the guy that I didn't want to do a contract but he literally said there was no other way. I have been with a lot of different energy companies and paid quarterly and no other company has affected my credit score. What a terrible way to function.In reply to the comment left - The amount of balance on the account is not the reason that my credit score dropped but the fact that it meant I had opened 3 'credit ' accounts within the space of two months. My mortgage and the two energy accounts, opening too many credit accounts within a short space of time is a big red flag to credit score companies and even though these accounts are now closed my credit score has still not yet recovered.

Jobs aren't being booked in correctly and they blame their systems and don't take responsibility for the issues caused. Engineers won't turn up during the day because they aren't being handed the jobs from dispatch - they then get sent the jobs at night, when they should have been done during the day!I am usually so happy with the service provided and really like the engineers who are usually so genuine and should be given more credit, but they get so much grief from customers, all due to the fault of the call centres who lie their way through their calls! I'm not sure whether it is lack of training or whether it's because they have moved their call centres to India, but the big guys at the top seriously need to buck their ideas up or they are going to lose so much custom!

We are sorry to have missed you' they hadn't as I was there all of the time ( also a card had not been put through the letter box informing me that they had been and missed me! ) on calling British Gas who on nvestingating ( 2nd time of callling having been cut off the first time) said that the engineer had been to the property and no one was in and the phone number had not connected!! This was recorded at a time when I had been in the house for 45mins - no knock on the door no call registered on the phone - oh but they could rebook for March!! A good month after the end of my contract - as I stated that due to today's treatment and apparent untruths I would not be renewing I was then informed that the annual service included under the contract would no longer be available ..... how does that make sense! Was also offered the £30 'goodwill' gesture and questioned why this amount when an annual service was more than double and was included in the contract and the missed appointment had been down to their error not mine as the customer !

Took 25 minutes on the phone to arrange this as the telesales guy didn't listen at all to what the problem was.Finally arranged the call for between 8 & 1pm. Engineer finally arrived about 1.30pm, his instructions were to repair the boiler and this call sheet was in a different customers name but with my address.The engineer used his laptop to find the right unit and said I would be better off paying a one off charge of £199. When I asked what it covered, I was told the part and 2 hours labour as he had to come back to do the work as a second visit, effectively meaning I was paying an hours charge of £78 for them to do the quote! He then said he needed to do safety checks even though he wasn't going to be replacing the unit that day. I said no as he could do all that when he came back to do the work, he became very irritated and said he couldn't do the job unless I allowed him to do that.By this time I was rather suspicious and asked him to wait while I phoned British Gas, at that he scooped up all his stuff, said he wouldn't do the job and stormed out.I phoned British Gas immediately to tell them what happened, the first person I spoke to said they would put me through to customer service and another person came on the line and said they would register the complaint andthen the line went dead. I phoned back on the same number but was then told that they could transfer me to customer services on that number although they apparently did before!I finally spoke to customer service explained what had happened and pointed out that I had left my card details with them for payment if I agreed to the work and I was concerned that I would be charged for this visit even though no work had been done. To begin with I was told I would be charged as the engineer has logged the call as completed but they eventually agreed that I would not be charged after I threatened to take it up with my bank. I guess time will tell on that one! I cannot believe that a company such as Britis Gas can behave like this, I am totally disgusted and will never use them again.

There appeared to be 2 existing debts on the pre pay gas meter from previous tenants (one for £826 and one for £56) after being advised that the quickest way to erase the £56 debt would be to pay it off via my gas card and for them to reimburse me back in gas credit via paypoint (not ideal as an unexpected £60 upfront at Christmas and after moving house left me a bit tight)  they assured me the £826 debt would be removed. In 1 month I have put £70 in the gas meter .... Expensive u reckon?! Bloody extortionate as I am a single occupant in a 2 bed who, due to shift work, is out of the house 3 full days/evenings a week. The heating is on for 1 hr in the morning and 1 hr in the evening and bathing from a brand new combi boiler and I don't use the lounge gas fire or cook. After 3x 1hr phone calls to the PAYG team and energy efficiency team they referred me to the team who arrange meter accuracy tests as they couldnt at all justify how much gas i was using considering my situation  but failed to communicate my case from one team to the next. I was put through to someone who had no desire to hear why I had been put through and was informed this would take 2 weeks. Then after being flippantly told all meters are tested prior to being installed so should all be accurate so should it come back inaccurate I'll be charged £62 for their trouble .... this nonchalant attitude after the problems i had experienced since being with British Gas was the last straw so I switched suppliers. It has become apparent that after all this the £826 existing debt (now £778.16) hasn't been wiped at all and I've been paying towards the debt. I rang BG again yesterday to ensure this would be wiped prior to my energy switch date as they aren't always wiped when new accounts are set up and as lovely and pleasant as they were on the phone they assured me they would ring me back within 5-10mins with an answer ... and nothing!!! Electricity has been great using only £5 per week but £17.50 per week for 3 baths, 1 load of washing up and a total of 14hrs of heating at 50°c is ridiculous and despite the BG team agreeing this was not right, not one person in the company could sort this issue for me making it still ongoing and for that they have lost a customer and I will NOT be recommending them to anyone I know! Now over to OVO energy ........ and in response to their response below .... just goes to show how much they know as screens 25 and 26 were still showing £5 on the 20/1/17 which is the min and max weekly debt repayment rate. I was with OVO only TWO days and by the afternoon of the 20/1/17 OVO had given a code to the relevant pay point and had removed the repayment rates! So for the first time since moving into the property on 13/12/16 screens 25 and 26 now read £0. 00 ... Thank you OVO!!! No wonder they've won awards for customer service 🏅I've been with them 2 weeks now and I am spending  £5 electric and  £9 gas (my heating is on about 5/6 hours a day now in oppose to the 2 hours previously with British Gas for £17.50) and they are fitting my smart meters today at no charge!!! Know who I'll be recommending .... !! 🏅

2,"            I accepted a quote from BG for a new boiler, which included a full power flush, an electrician, as there was some complex rewiring to be done as well as the cutting of a new hole for the flue and re bricking up the old hole. . The whole job was to take a day and a half. Delivery of the materials ahead of installation day went well. On installation day the fitter spent some time swearing under his breath at himself, he was not a BG engineer but a local subcontractor. He completed the entire job in 3/4 of a day, despite me asking him three times he did not flush out the radiators, which I had paid for. There was no need for a new hole for a flue, again work that I had paid for. Then the electrician turned up he was here for 30 minutes to connect the boiler, there was no additional wiring or work needed and for 30 minutes work I was charged £196.93. I contacted British Gas  customer relations to raise my issues. They were very good and responsive, I had a visit from their district manager, who arranged for another engineer to carry out the system flush correctly he also refunded the overcharging for the brick work and unused materials, this was excellent customer care. However he wasn't prepared to address the issue of being charged for a full days work by an electrician which took 30 minutes as they work on a unit cost system. To me if a unit cost for a days work is X and you buy 20% of a unit you should pay 20% of the cost I remain totally dissatisfied with this aspect of my experience. Additionally I was offered a compensatory payment of £100, apparently it would be normally £25 but he was upping it due to the issues involved. After some negotiation he agreed to £150, in my view a good offer if he had also looked at the over charge for electrical work. I will continue to take this point up with their customer service team. I wonder how many others have been overcharged like this?  If I hadn't complained they would have quite happily kept my money and I suspect that of many others. For me the moral is don't trust them and look elsewhere.

1,"            have homecare 200 agreement which have had for many years. annual service visit included in cost, but the visits now being booked beyond the 12 months as told no earlier dates available and then being moved again from first date, despite booking it 2 months in advance . Annual service will now be at 16 months, not within 12 and they have booked a 5 hr time slot instead of 2hr one . BG obviously working on different calendar to rest of world.  This is second time this has happened and mother in law been getting the same run around for a few years as well. Managers don't ring back and only offered £30 for appointment cancellation. What about the £79.30 for the annual service that they haven't done. Awaiting call back from manager again before probably escalating matter to ofgem. according to BG can't make first date due to emergencies - how do they know of emergencies 4 weeks in advance? must have the crystal ball out!so BG have replied - they still think annual means more than 12 months. In my case it will be 16 months. So I am either going to get 2 annual services within  the 12 month period since my annual contract renewal in september 2016 or my 2017 annual service for the new contract will again take place beyond the 12 months. I'm still owed money for the annual service I did not receive within the last 12 month contract and I will pursue this. £79.30 is owed to me

At 14.20 someone from British Gas called to say the engineer was running late. At 5pm when. On one had arrived I called customer service who informed me the appt had been moved to afternoon and this was up to 6pm. He was unable to keep me on hold to discuss with the relevant team due to high volume of calls. I was asked to call back at 5.30pm. Which I did. I was then informed that the engineer would not be attending. I was offered £10 voucher for my inconvenience!!!!! Which I politely declined. So I sat in all day and waited with no central heating on as I was told the boiler had to be cool to service it. I have missed my GP appointment and wasted a day annual leave. I am very disappointed British Gas. Maybe you should think of treating your customers a bit better. I will be moving my account both Gas and Electric to a different supplier and sending a formal complaint.

I have an important job Executive Assistant to  Chief Executive.  Took day off work halfway through the morning received a call informing me they were busy and my appointment would be rearranged. Not happy so asked for my complaint to be escalated.  Operations Manager did call back promptly when I requested compensation for my day off work was offered £30. Obviously this would not cover my inconvenience and days salary. Next day decided to put my complaint in writing. No acknowledgement within 48 hours as website states so called to make sure my complaint had been received. Informed that it had and a letter was on its way to me. Several weeks later no letter so drafted a letter to Helen Emms Head of Customer Relations. After a further call I have received an acknowledgement saying they are dealing with my complaint. I have already drafted my complaint letter to the Ombudsman and their CEO which will only be deleted if I do not receive the appropriate compensation for my inconvenience. Absolutely appalled by the poor service from BG. Having spoken to friends and reading numerous reviews it is no wonder I am with EDF. Used for the past 5 years great service and value!!

Then the engineer said he couldn't fix it as the company that made the cooker had gone bust basically. So I said ok what happens then? He said you will get 100% of the cost for a new cooker because it's under 3 years old. I said that's great thank you. I have a call 3 hours after he left of British Gas's insurance company saying they are only paying 30% towards a new one!! Well I was straight back on the phone to British Gas and aparantly they didn't know why! So was advised to ring the insurance claims department back! After being on the phone for 30 minutes they wanted a receipt!! There was nothing in my contract saying a receipt will be needed so I told them this. So they said phone British Gas back!! Can you believe this! I phoned them back and after another 30 minutes on the phone I was told the engineer had said it was over 3 years old! I told them that's not true! I was told it's been passed on to customer relations and now have to wait 48 hours with no cooker! What kind of customer service is this! I'm now going to cancel everything I have with British Gas!

1,"            If you ever contemplate signing up for British Gas homecare or using a British Gas engineer - DON'T!!! I could write pages and pages but buttomline is the service is shockingly bad and most engineers are extremly icompetent. Two examples in brief (the list could go on): 1.) In summer 2015 we had a water pipe burst in the children's bed room. The pipe only got to the point of bursting because an engineer who we had been there earlier in the day misdiagnosed the problem. When it burst, water was litterally flooding the house, coming through the ceiling, lamps and light sockets. Yet, it took the emergency engineer 5 or 6 hours to come. By then the house was so damaged that it we could not live in it anymore for months and it needed major repair and refurbishment work. We never got all costs reimbursed (let alone compensation for the incovenience) neither from the insurance, no British Gas. 2.) We installed a new boiler in the house (which is now rented out, i.e. we have become landlords) as the old one was getting dated and we needed something reliable. Ever since the new boiler was installed our tenants had issues that again got misdiagnosed multiple times. Bare in mind, each time you ask for an engineer you get a half day slot, i.e. time of work etc. Recently, as the temperatures dropped below freezing the heating and warm water failed all together. To make a long story short...the family who has two young children was without heating or hot water for almost a week. After an appointment where nobody showed up, an engineer then improvised a temporary solution and now requested we call a Building Company! to remove some insulation foam from a cut pipe before they are willing to finish the job. Understandably, no local builders company can be bothered, neither can any other local tradesmen. In other words the problem still hasn't been solved! And the people at the call center only stick to their guidelines but won't help either. Anyways, as I said I could go on, and on, and on...but if you want a competent company that cares about solving your problem DO NOT use BG! We have in fact decided to cancel our homecare agreement with them at the earliest possible moment. Btw, the internet is full of other customers who have made similar experiences. There are even ""I hate BG facebook pages out there"". So be aware!

I explained I was not happy and was put through to retentions, where I explained my situation and that I am currently unwell, but was told there was nothing they could do.

I rang today but was told that the repair job in 2014 was classed as the first annual service and the the next one was for next year 17/18.

I took time off work to be here and the engineer didn't show. British Gas did not have the courtesy of advising me that the appointment had been cancelled even though I had received confirmation earlier in the day that the engineer would arrive as promised. I then made another appointment via a Manager - for which I had to wait 10 days - and the engineer again failed to arrive and I was not informed. When I called British Gas to see where the engineer was, I was again informed that the engineer had been cancelled because they had too many emergencies/more important calls to make. I asked to speak to a Manager and was on the phone for 45 minutes to British Gas trying to reach a resolution to this matter. I now have to wait a further 6 days to get my washing machine fixed and, because I feel that my machine is dangerous,I have been told not to use it at all. I find this service, which I pay for and in good faith, absolutely terrible. Dealing with British Gas is extremely stressful and a great waste of my time. Speaking initially to the lady on the phone I felt that their customers were not important and that it was perfectly fine for British Gas to cancel appointments as and when they deem it necessary and that it was fine not to inform waiting customers of their decision. I do not recommend this service to anybody as it is not worth the loss of time or the stress it entails when you need to rely on such a service and I no longer have any confidence in British Gas at all.

The twitter people @BritishGasHelp try to help but they don't seem to know very much and just seem to be a PR front-end to more specialist help which never seems to be forthcoming.Does British Gas never look at its own help pages ?. The average rating seems to be one star which is a disgrace. From experience, I know that emails are often just ignored and so I rang in with a few queries and spoke to a lady who seemed helpful. We agreed that I should put my queries in an email and send them directly to her. I thought that I was finally making progress but three weeks later I have heard nothing and didn't even get an acknowledgement.As to the website, sometimes it works and often it doesn't. As an example, I received an email today from British Gas (wow) saying my latest bill is ready to view. Have I been able to view it ?. No but I've had several ""Bad request""s and trying again just now, I get :Oops, something went wrong.Sorry, we're having technical problems at the moment. Please come back and try again later.This is typical of the flaky website which I don't think has been tested properly. I think British Gas needs to go on a customer service training course as it doesn't seem to know anything about it.

Bunch of money grabbers who will leave you in the lurch. This happened to me and I would never trust them again.In reply to Jamie below writing today It seems British Gas won't allow a reply to the below post, so I'll put it here! I specifically asked if existing faults were covered. I was told yes. I agree the valve was replaced to the boiler. If BG had told me the previous owner of the property had requested a repair, when I phoned it would be a different matter. How am I meant to know that? The engineer came to the HWT after I had established it would be covered. The fact that there was a chargeable repair the previous owner had been told about is irrelavent. What it amounts to is BG take money off customers and when they find out a repair will cost more than they would make out of a contract, they cancel it. BG did refund 3 payments of £22, but kept £99 due to the boiler repair. BG should not tell customers everything is covered, e.g. it states Central Heating in the contract, if they exclude certain items.

As a long time BG customer I was quite excited at the prospect of having the new system as described ... unfortunately the quote of £8000 was more than double what local, reputable firms are quoting. Why are BG pricing themselves out of the market? I was not having anything other than standard radiators of varying size and a combi boiler yet the price was extortionate.

My first experience was in my first home when they insisted I had to pay the debt the previous resident had accrued and were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. Only when I agreed to go to court over this debt did they reluctantly agree to waive the bill as a 'goodwill gesture'. I spent many unproblematic years with another supplier but when I moved to my current property it was unfortunately supplied by British Gas. They have taken ridiculously long periods of time to answer simple queries; did not credit my account with money I had put on the pre-payment meter when they switched it to a normal billing meter, it took them months to give me the number I needed to call to sort it out and when I called I was passed from department to department and back again, spending long periods of time on hold, only to be cut off so I have to call again and be put on hold again. They seem completely clueless, no-one appears to know what they're doing and just keep passing you to someone else to get rid of you. It very much feels like all they care about is your money, they certainly don't care about their customers.

Told them was having problems with the radiators and as it was getting colder they needed looking at, usually the engineer checks they are all balanced when he does the service. Was told service wasn't available but if I wanted to book a callout (£50 excess) for the radiators, the service could be done at the same time. This seemed the best way forward so I went ahead, they took payment up front, the engineer arrived, checked all the radiators, said they were all fine but said he wan't booked to do the service and wouldn't be doing it.  Since then, the radiators aren't fine and so phoned them again today to book the service, was told that it is company policy not to carry out services in the winter months and first available service appointment was end of February.Apparently, the callout was booked to be  aservice as well but it was cancelled, he couldn't see by who! Also, apparently an annual service doesn't mean having your boiler serviced around the same time of year annually, according to them, annual means within the contract period. Nuts! Never used to be this bad. Have they been taken over? Bought out or are the bosses just happily lining their pockets with our annual fees which 9/10 are only for a dust and co2 check?

The call was terminated and  a switch made to Sainsbury's Energy. I received a bill for gas and electricity used  whilst with British Gas, which was wholly inaccurate but when I tried to input proper readings, was advised I did not have any accounts to submit readings for..  probably because of the switch... I rang the British Gas call centre again and got an equally useless assistant who said i could not have a final bill until Sainsburys told B.Gas the final readings... I thought that was odd as  I presumed it would be the other way around.. However - MY BIGGEST concern was that I wanted to pay the final bill but was prevented from doing this; but was assured no further action would be taken in terms of debt letters. I rang Sainsburys (and the staff member was so helpful in comparison) and the agent at Sainsbury's rang British Gas for me while I was on the phone and agreed the final readings and British Gas then finalised the account.. Would never have been done without the intervention of the new supplier ...  The final bill was paid 28.12 within minutes of the final account being created but I am HORRIFIED to find out that despite that and despite the account saying it should be paid before 3rd January - that my son has received a letter from a debt recovery company... This is absolutely outrageous to treat a vulnerable customer in this way and I am disgusted and will never use British Gas again for anything.. I understand that there is a connection between Sainsburys Energy and British Gas but - whatever that is - it is most certainly not the staff in the respective call centres...   one set of whom are quite simply terrible and the other as good as it gets...As regards the debt letter - taking into account this mess was because of the inefficiency of the foreign call centre - I am considering what action to take here.  If there was a box for zero stars - I would have used that..

1,"            Difficult to book a boiler service as limited availability for appointments.When booked more than one subsequent call from British Gas requesting to delay the service for two months.Original appointment for service cancelled without my knowledge or consent after being told it would stand as it was but would probably be cancelled on the day.Very poor treatment of a loyal customer.I have made a complaint but have been told to expect  7 to 28 days for a result. Will update this review if and when British Gas Homecare come back to me.Nearly two weeks have passed and all I have had is a pro forma letter to say they are dealing with my complaint. Should have been having my boiler serviced tomorrow but no chance of it happening. Can't deal with servicing boilers and can't deal with complaints. What is happening to this company?31/01/17 Another two weeks have past and still no response to my complaint, this is not a complex issue. I have lost all faith in British Gas.08/02/17 Finally got a response from British Gas after moaning again to them that they had not dealt with my complaint. I am going to be financially compensated for their lack of service. The Complaints Manager I spoke with now appears to have dealt with the matter properly, I just hope they turn up for the boiler service which is now booked for early March.

1,"            My experience of British Gas in the past has always been extremely good until recently when I was utterly flabbergasted and then annoyed beyond belief by the lack of knowledge of the telephone team and lack of just simple general common sense. My old boiler which was under their care agreement was replaced by a new boiler.  I was told not to cancel direct debit on old agreement; they would deal with it.  The next payment for the old boiler went out after my new boiler was fitted.  I rang up and was told this money would be returned.  It wasn't.  Unfortunately I hadn't cancelled my direct debit in time and another payment went out.  I rang again and was told to provide my old agreement number.  I was told that no payment would be returned without that as they could not find me on the system.  I found that agreement number and when I rang in they told me I needed to also provide the scheme name under which I had received the boiler (it was running at less than 70% efficiency and so we received a new boiler but had to pay for the fitting and hive etc). I simply could not remember but surely that info was to hand for them? No.  I was given a number to call to find the scheme name and then to call them back.I rang this number and there was no record of us having a boiler fitted at all!  I rang the customer service team back again and told them this.Again the person I spoke to seemed to be missing the obvious and they could not find us on the system as having a new boiler at all.  Someone would  call me back.  I was persistent and it eventually boiled down to the date the boiler was fitted (which I had stated in phone call number 4. Luckily for me, through this information it was established that we do actually exist; we did actually have a boiler fitted by them and we did actually have a previous care agreement and we are actually owed money!Why on earth this took 5 phone calls, frustration and total ""flabbergastness"" on my part I will never know.  I was told that a payment would be coming out to me by cheque.  I reckon I must have spent in total about an hour and a half of my time trying to get these people to do their job.  Appalling.  The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.

1,"            They installed my boiler which broke down every year, then tried to disassoiciate themselves by 'accidentally' cancelling my home care agreement - as repairing their own duff boiler and faulty work was costing them too much.  Fortunately I keep all my paperwork and they were forced to put my homecare agreement back into place.  Can you believe it - I checked my credit report and they cheeky .......... have put a note on it saying that the homecare wasn't paid!!  An overseas call centre proved to be difficult to deal with and could not understand the credit reference issue, thus this will sit on my credit reference for 72 months!  I would suggest you only interact with this company if you are happy with this type of conduct, I was certainly not.  They agreed they were incorrect and would remove the notice but they have not yet and it has been over 6 months now.  Frankly, poor standard of equipment, poor standard of conduct and poor standard of complaint service.

1,"            Whilst going through what would seem like a bread a butter process for a company like british gas they have managed to turn it into a nightmare. I moved house in April 16 and only managed to close my previous accounts in December 16. I gave my final reads on the day I moved out and unfortunately had to provide them four times after that because British gas decided they would send me estimated ones for the months following after that.That doesn't sound that bad I agree. But following this they decided to send me a redbate on my previous property. Which I rang to say was Incorrect. Only be to told it was fine and I should cash the cheque. What do you suspect happened the next month?...  can we have our money back please? What a completely disorganised mess of a company. I will definitely be closing my accounts in my new property.

1,"            After being billed a ridiculously high bill, which I never encountered throughout my years of experience with British Gas, it's taking me more than six months to resolve the issue. Although an employee I spoke to even admit that the bill was unrealistic, it seems like I am the only one trying to resolve the issue! My phone bill has exceeded the electricity bill from the numerous times I have tried to call them to resolve the issue and I'm always left with broken promises. For the fourth time now, I was told that a supervisor would call back to finally resolve the issue and have yet to hear from one at the agreed time and date (since i am abroad and have to plug in my UK chip just for the call). It doesn't help that one employee even brought me to tears by refusing to help me by accusing me of never submitting a meter reading (although the next employee i spoke to found that surprising since she mentioned that all my submitted readings were recorded in the system). It's a complete joke that such a known company is treating its customers so poorly and especially one who is trying to meet them halfway and actually pay what is due (but not be exploited at the same time)! It's honestly embarrassing for the company that customers are being treated this way. And the worst part? British Gas reported me to a debt collection agency even though I'm the only trying to resolve the issue (which has been filed as a mistake) and get the payment through yet I'm being treated as if I'm completely ignoring the situation!!!

1,"            I've had nothing but trouble with British Gas and this month instead of the £120 a month I pay normally they have taken £180 from me. £60 is a lot of money when you're not on a big salary! that's not the worst part, they didn't even inform me my direct debit was due to increase. They didn't send me a letter, email or didn't phone me either. This is against the law, energy providers by right have to give you at least 10 days notice before amending things like this but no, I didn't receive anything from them. Do not switch to British gas, you'll have nothing but hassle.

1,"            I can't believe the treatment we have received. We have been waiting over a month for our heating to be fixed. Appointments are continually cancelled and engineers arrive and tell us they are not able to carry out the job. I have a 2 year old sleeping in the house with no heating- as a result has a chest infection. We have still been told we are not a priority. I am disgusted with the customer service I have received when I call up. I've had several staff members hang up on me,  guarantee that someone would definitely arrive that day for the engineers not to turn up and I have also been spoken to rudely over the phone. BG have refused to put us up in a hotel. I was asked whether my daughter was likely to need an ambulance called for her chest infection- if so, only then would we be put on the SOS emergency list.

It's way more expensive than the other companies for both gas and electricity plus they have 26p per day standing charge for both meters ( Electricity and Gas) no matter what type of meter you get, PYG, Prepaid or smart meter. Also Customer service is the worst, they swear at customers, 3 different people from British Gas hanged up on me in one day.

After phoning British Gas on 28th December because our central heating was faulty, I was more than delighted when the engineer (his employee number 47047) arrived within two hours. Today (29th) he was with us again very early (8.30am) and found it necessary to fit a new pump. We were very impressed with the service from Chris 47047 a great advert for British Gas. As the weather is very cold we are very grateful for this excellent service.

I was told to ring the customer service after 15 minutes I was told the can't even give a quote until six weeks time and then an approx. wait of a further month. The operator actually advised that I try another company. Update: I took Jamie-Lee's advice (below) and have a local plumber booked for this week. No hanging on the phone or waiting for non existing call back. Much cheaper than the estimated costs presented on British Gas forums. So I recommend that people take Jamie-Lee's advice and try alternatives before contacting British Gas. That may help them clear their eternal backlog.

1,"            I have recently tried to book a homecare drain visit on a subdivided property.  The cover does not include shared drains unless all properties have the coverage (which they do). Therefore British Gas receive 3 times the premiums for the total property.To access the coverage all properties must phone to report the fault which is inconvenient but the systems are unable to link the policies therefore making it virtually impossible to schedule a visit.When the first visit was scheduled the Dyno engineer said 'the office' had no booking from all policy holders and therefore could not undertake the work.  The second visit was scheduled for Tuesday 27th and no one turned up.  The catalogue of errors in the process, the systems and the knowledge of the call centre staff is the worst I have ever experienced.  I will be cancelling my cover and my British Gas energy supply. They were efficient at one part of the process which was taking payment for the £50 excess!

1,"            On 11th December booked online engineer to fix dishwasher and fridge freezer. Received 2 confirmation emails for both jobs to be repaired on 15th December between 8-1pm. Wednesday 14th in the evening received another email to say appointment was on track. Waited in from 8-1pm no phone call or show by engineer. At 1pm I phoned British Gas to find out where the engineer was to be told appointment cancelled rescheduled for 23rd December !!!. Apparently they phoned day before to let me know but the fact I wasnt in to take the call was irrelevant. Did not received an email cancelling the old appoinment or affirming the new appointment. I was extremely angry about this I pay about £700 a year for this abysmal service. I demanded to speak to a supervisor who just kept saying sorry. I said what happens if the engineer turns up on the 23rd and cant fix my problems I will be left without a dishwasher over Xmas, she said it should be ok to get fixed. Well guess what engineer turned up today and decided couldnt fix anything parts have to be ordered...5th January 2017 is the next appointment !! I have registered a complaint with British Gas its taken them 7 days just to acknowledge it. I shall be taking steps to remove everything I pay for with British Gas. By the way Jamie dont bother leaving your rehearsed reply to my review its just another example of British Gas poor customer serviceUpdate on 5th January appointment booked by engineer to fit parts. Booked from 8-1pm phone call at 12.54 to tell me engineer off sick cant find a replacement !!!! Want to rebook the appointment to 16th January.  Slammed the phone down I am so angry.Update on 16th January Waited in all morning as booked 8-1pm. Checked my account online confirmation there of date and time. No phone call or show by engineer. Rang BG was cut off by Ahmed as he couldnt find the apppointment. Phoned back again spoke to Ryan who could see it. He could not give me an explanation why the engineer had not arrived promised to phone me back with the result. 2 calls recived from BG but my house phone decided to play up disconnecting incoming calls so I called back hour later. Lady confirmed that Ryan was calling to reschedule my appointment. I said no this is the 3rd cancellation no calls no appearance by engineer. I pay £67 a month for them to keep my money and not repair my items. Put me through to the cancellation department, she refused, I asked for telephone no. she refused. She said they were closed now it was about 3.30pm. ??? I found the cancellation phone no. online 0800 294 9123 spoke to a young man who said he would raise another complaint for me. I have cancelled the direct debit aswell. I will await the complaint process then possibly raise the issue with the Financial Ombudsman as BG are clearly not providing the service they are being paid for.

1,"            I signed up to British Gas Homecare because, amongst other things, the annual boiler service sounded a great idea.  In 2016 I was expecting my next annual service in September, a year after the last, and of course a sensible time, being just before the onset of winter.  I was told that due to a lack of engineers in my area this had to be put back to 22nd November!  I wasn't happy, but accepted it.  A few days before 22nd November (but, interestingly, just after I'd renewed my annual agreement) I was called *again*!  Again, apparently there were no engineers in my area and the best they could do was January!!  This time I complained vociferously, but was offered no compensation for this breach of contact on initial call.  On the second call I was offered £30.  On the third call, a very *helpful* man called Gareth Edwards at the Stockport Office found that I was actually entitled to a total of £90 and that a cheque would be sent.  Unfortunately he couldn't rearrange the appointment for earlier than January, but, as he'd been so helpful, and I was receiving compensation, I accepted this. On 22nd December I was wondering when the cheque was going to arrive (it had been a month) AND...INCREDIBLY...ANOTHER call from British Gas!  To say...'sorry, there are no engineers in your area' and they were saying they wanted to put the JAN appointment back!  I was obviously very annoyed, explained the situation re earlier complaints/compensation to the rep.  She reinstated the appointment and said that she would put something on the system so that I wouldn't be called again.  Today (23rd December) I had a missed call from British Gas.  Now, I am 95% certain that that will be yet another call to tell me 'there are no engineers in the area' and that the Jan appt will have to be put back again.  I rang Stockport office and spoke to David Graham.  All I wanted him to assure me is that this appointment would be kept and there would be NO more phone calls trying to put the appointment back yet again.  He was not prepared to give me this assurance! Although I explained the history, this man was unsympathetic, unhelpful and had no empathy whatsoever!  He even asked me to consider the customers with 'disabilities' who had priority!!  How can earth can a 'customer service' person say this to a customer with my history?? So - British Gas = break the terms of their agreement by not being able to give me a service within a year and give me an appointment two months OVER the year, then they put THAT appointment back by two months, then they ring to put THAT appointment back, then they try to lay a guilt trip on me by reminding me of customers who have 'disabilities'!!  (And it's after my conversation with this man that I decided I had to leave this review, at least to warn others!!)All this grief for...three hundred quid a year! (In the years I've had the agreement I've only had the boiler checks - have never called them out.)  This company STINKS.  I'm sorry the lovely Gareth Evans has to work for them.  As soon as I can I will be cancelling the Homecare agreement and will do all I can to dissade anyone from using British Gas for Homecare, for their power, for anything.  I shall never forget this.EDIT - the call on 23rd Dec, that I feared was British Gas saying the Jan appt couldn't be met...I was right!  Later in the day, yes, they phoned again.  I explained the situation YET AGAIN, and a helpful lady told me I *could* actually cancel my contract, even though I'd just renewed, as I'd been paying in arrears and hadn't had any call-outs.  So, I've cancelled.  Thank goodness, thank goodness, thank goodness.FURTHER EDIT - I never got the £90.  In February British Gas contacted me to 'discuss' my complaint (a Shona FitzPatrick).  They contacted me by e-mail and asked me to phone them.  I tried phoning them.  The lady had gone home.  This was 27th February.  So, I e-mailed a reply, asking them to get back to me by e-mail, and waited for them to contact me.  On 6th March I received an e-mail from them, saying that they hadn't heard from me (??!!), and that if they did not hear they would assume I did not wish to take the matter further.  I can only imagine British Gas are on some sort of mission to drive their customers AND ex-customers crazy.EDIT - W/C 14th March received an e-mail from Shona saying they apologised for the problems and would be sending a cheque for £180 as compensation.  I didn't hold out much hope of this coming BUT am pleased to report that it actually came very quickly - received today.  Many thanks to Shona for implementing this payment so quickly.  It suggests that British Gas are starting to 'sort things out' - cause for optimism.

British gas were unrepentant and if I required the leak fixed they would do this and leave the shower unit totally useless leaning up against the bathroom wall, I am totally speechless to their lack of common sense and they think that a shower/bath unit is not an essential item in any home.

I signed up for the annual servicing package in October, and booked the first available service possible which was mid January 2017 - so nearly a 3 month wait, but was happy to wait. Today I get a phone call from a call centre saying - regarding your January appt- January is our busiest period for breakdowns and we need to reserve all our appointments for breakdown customers only and therefore need to move your appointment to MARCH - 3 months later. I asked the BG person - why make appointments available online to book if they are not really available, or is it now you have my money upfront I am not a priority, I refused to accept the cancellation to which the caller said BG have the right to cancel any appointments I make over and over again. I then said if you cancel my appt I want a full refund to cancel this service to which I was told NO. So... beware anyone signing up for this service - they take you money upfront then you wait months for an appt only to be called and told you are not a priority customer due to winter breakdowns and we need to wait another 3 months and have no right to a refund because they can do what they like..... first class service BG Think carefully before signing up

Your advisor went through to the accounts team and told me they were not interested.The last advisor i have spoken to has been the only one who i think actually cared about the reputation of the company and getting the concern resolved sadly>>>>>>>>>>>

1,"            After over 5 years with British Gas I have decided to switch as the service they provide is just disgusting! Nothing is easy and people on the phone are rude and useless. Nothing gets done but they sure do over charge you!

1,"            I pay £500 a year for the British Gas Homecare service for my appliances.  Not had a great experience in the past, my last call in 2014 they took five months of missed appointments, to decide my relatively new dishwasher was irreparable.  They sold me a new one, which was delivered and found to be not working, and also irreparable.  Eventually after a huge of amount of time on the phone and via email, it got sorted out, - but what a performance!I kept the contract with British Gas, and on 14th December, I discovered that my full height freezer, stocked with all my Christmas and New Year’s goodies was not freezing.  I contacted Homecare and requested a priority appointment as I was aware food would keep in a freezer for 48 hours without power.  The appointment I was offered was 28th December, two weeks hence.  I informed them this was not acceptable as my food would spoil, and after a number of phone calls, a complaint to Customer Services, I was offered 23rd December, and then 22nd December.  All irrelevant as all the food in my freezer would have spoiled.  I have been informed that I should claim for the lost food from my home insurance.  Great, so British Gas do not provide a service they are being paid for, and I would have the hassle of disposing of a freezer of rotten food, trying to replace it over the busiest time of the year, and have my insurance premiums rocket because they cannot get their act together.I have repeatedly asked for a senior manager to contact me.  A week later I am still waiting.I have indicated that I intend to escalate this matter, contact their CEO, Ofgem, post on the internet and look into taking a case to Small Claims.  It’s knock your head off brick wall time, and they are simply unconcerned and it really does not matter what you say to them, - they don’t listen.I dumped the contents of my freezer today and I have written to Mark Hodges, CEO, - not holding my breath for a reply.  I am speaking to Citizens Advice regarding whatever rights I may have.  To be honest, taking money off me every month and then refusing to provide the service, borders on fraud to me.  I am elderly and not in the best of health, and really could do without all this hassle over the Christmas period.  So my advice to anyone is to give so called “Homecare” a miss and keep the premiums aside and replace or repair your appliances when required.  This is an expensive con that will leave you out of pocket and stress you beyond belief.

2,"            To much time on your hands, with too much money ? British Gas has a solution, spend that money on Home Care. They take your money and then when you book an appointment they fail to arrive - simple really.I had a booking from 8.00 to 1.00. At 12.15 I was informed the engineer wouldn't be arriving. Either rebook the appointment for another day or stay in until 6.00 . Why couldn't they have informed me earlier than 1215?  No! that would be to much like customer service - avoid if you can,

1,"            Years of mistreatment from British Gas culminated recently with a bailiff wanting money for bills unseen. Web systems that don't work. Rude staff and an email today from the digital director who's linked in profile says he left the company a month ago. Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Avoid. I have edited this review in light of the reply to clarify why this was resolved. I received an email from Arslan Sharif, Digital Director or British Gas. I looked him up and found a linkedin profile stating that he no longer worked at BG. Still I found a private email for him, contacted him and he was good enough to forward the complaint back to BG at a much higher level and ONLY when this happened did BG get to the stage of taking my complaint seriously. Miraculously, a complaint that had taken YEARS (yes, you read correctly) was sorted with one phone call. Arslan Sharif left BG in November 2016, but in Jan 2017, I am still receiving emails from a man that moved on over a month ago. This is how BAD BG is. Yes, my complaint is now revolved, but  I have absolutely no faith that BG's systems are suitable or robust enough to prevent ongoing problems.

1,"            I've been reading all negative comments about Homecare and broken appointments etc on this website.I'm leaving this review to explain why you are getting all these problems....1. Hundreds of engineers are leaving all over the country because of shifts, bullying, no work life balance and aggressive sales targets set by the Directors of the company. Of course they'll deny this but look at this..British Gas JobsAll over the country. They just wont listen just carry on bullying, bullying and bullying.How do I know this? Ex British Gas that's how!!2. They are now a FCA contract. It was changed for taxation savings. Unfortunately, for you (The customers) are now on a insurance based contract. So if you have a breakdown you are making a claim! Guess what? Your premium goes up. Its a individual contract between you your boiler and them. If your appliance is problematic you'll pay through the nose next year.3. All the despatch and appointments are now in INDIA. After all the big companies are bringing all their admin back to the UK BG are sending them out??? So advice time... Why pay hundreds of pounds year on year? Have a new appliance privately through a Gas Safe engineer and experience real customer care

Was tol;dd that I was next and very sorry Engineer was running late, expect a call 30 mins before. Got a call from BG in the afternoon to say that they were not coming due to ""a customer break down, taking priority"". they were very apologetic and offered a 2 hour time slot between 10:00 & 12:00 today. (hey ho!)No show again, so I called BG. They said that they were not coming as they were not quoting for new jobs until March 2017. When I pointed out that I was already booked in for a quote, I was told to find another Company or independent gas fitter."" Companies are quick to moan when things don't go their way, but continue to give cr*p customer service, across the board. Will leaving the EU change this? I doubt it""

1,"            I used to speak so highly of British Gas' service, but I've now lost confidence in them.On a recent visit the engineer - who did a very good and efficient job - had left his number in case of problems. I contacted him and asked him to come and add some water sealant and he said he would and told me which day. He never came, nor responded to a further message. So I booked another visit, now finding a thermostatic control had broken.When British Gas arrived last Thursday there were THREE engineers for what turned out to be a 10 minute job, the original engineer, a senior engineer and a trainee. I was mildly threatened by the senior engineer (something he'd done on a previous visit) about asking for further visits relating to my water pressure and told it was very expensive sending out three engineers (I had not asked for three...). The three men then proceeded to have a tea break (?) for some time outside my house. I wondered if this time were being attributed to my visit. I am also concerned that additional people are coming on routine visits to increase my annual charge next year.I now have another broken valve (the valves were put on at the same time so perhaps not surprising if they fail at around the same time) but I have no desire to be ticked off again for using a policy I have paid for. This visit should take all of 5 minutes. But how can I ensure they only send one person?I would like to be treated with respect and for British Gas to use some judgement in operating  their policy of sending a senior engineer after several visits.1 January: today I find my boiler is leaking again apparently from the same place which has been repaired several times already. Will they treat me with respect this time when they come to repair this and the broken valve? Will they be proportionate in their use of manpower?5 January: three weeks and no reply from British Gas to this review!Two phone calls cancelling appointments, the one for Wed 4th and now the one for today. Same questions asked me about the faults. I understand that people without heating and water are a priority but why hasn't British Gas factored in additional staff to deal with post Christmas/New Year emergencies since this is something which can be expected?9 January still no reply to this review - and now a third cancelled appointment, this time with no phone call. As a customer it feels as though British Gas is in meltdown. Is it?10 January: FOURTH cancelled appointment - although this time I had the courtesy of a phone call and an offer of £30 compensation.11 January: boiler leaking again...

They assured me that an engineer could come on Monday 12th, meaning i had to take a day unpaid leave from work.On Monday morning, they called again to say he couldn't make it.I now lose a days pay, have no heating and no hot water, and British Gas are completely OK with this.TWICE.

Luckly I remembered the day before and checked my emails. I waited for the whole day but no engineer has turned up. I checked with customer service on the same day afternoon and they also confirmed that engineer will be visiting home between 2pm to 4pm. But none has turned up. I called the customer care in the evening and they dont have any clue why the engineer hasn't turn up. They said that they will rebook the appointment and next slot of appointment is on sometime February 20017. Its really annonying and frustating. I asked to cancel my homecare and return all my money back and they agreed to do so.  I will recommend everyone not to choose homecare from British Gas. Go to a smaller supplier where they can provide good service.

At 9.50 I received a call that the engineer would not be keeping the appointment, it was only after pressing, a second appointment was organised for between 12-2pm. No engineer attended. I called to be advised they would attend but no time could be given. I called again at 5.50 this time I was on the phone for more than 50 minutes. They could not find my account despite me spelling out the address giving my surname which is extremely unusual and therefore should be easy to find. I also gave my customer ID. No joy couldn't find my account. I offered to forward the E mail confirming the appointment but that was not possible because they cannot give out their E.mails addresses. This is British Gas not MI5! Eventually I spoke to a manager who was able to find it because he had better listening skills and understood when I explained my house name comprised of two words. By this time it was almost 6.30 and I had been waiting for 8 and a half hours! I had to cancel the appointment because I had an evening engagement. The next alternative offered was for 3 months time! British Gas has no respect for its customers, their time and it is Laughable the product is called HomeCARE

1,"            My response to BG answer is this ... ""What?  No, of course not.  Please don't reply - there really isn't any point.""I've felt physically sick dealing with this company.  New boiler installed in the early days of Hive heating control - a gas leak that meant we had to evacuate the house, potentially lethal and criminally negligent electrical installation - and that wasn't by any means the stressful part.  Hive was installed by three separate teams who had not the remotest idea what they were doing and it took about 40 phone calls to resolve with seven visits to my house.  Staff on site were (largely) nice but those on the phone are clearly empowered to do nothing but read from a script and although BG sells itself as an integrated company which provides a range of services, the moment you need to make use of this you will be faced with a range of quite angry people on the phone explaining slowly and loudly that no, these are all completely separate companies.Dangerous, incompetent and in the most recent experience with HomeCare they carried out a minor repair, made the leak worse and then because my policy had expired I was told - quite robustly -  that I had no claim because I didn't have insurance with them.  And no, their repairs didn't come with any kind of guarantee.Your experience may differ, but judging from the reviews on this webpage I don't think it will differ all that much.  I wouldn't touch them with a bargepole.As a final note, the company I work for used to have a referral process where we would transfer our customers (on getting the right kind of enquiry) through to BG so they could become a Home Care customer too.  It was making us quite a lot of money but we cancelled about three years ago because it was just embarrassing to be associated with BG and was damaging our brand.  Things have definitely not improved since then.

1,"            Took landlords boiler and controls cover, paid in advance for 12 months with auth code and bank statements to prove, bg harassed me every month asking me to pay again, at the end of the 12 month term I foolishly took another 12 months of cover and again paid up front with proof I had paid, I later found out that they had used my most recent payment to cover what they said I hadn't paid for in the previous year. So now I've paid double for October 2015 to October 2016 and I'm pretty certain had I needed to make a claim that year it would have been denied on the grounds that they hadn't acknowledged my payment. I'm now left out of pocket and without cover. Customer service is beyond a joke, average of 25 mins waiting time and when I do get through I either get hung up on, given a different number where nobody answers or usually promised a call back by a supervisor or manager which in 2 months and 6 different cases of this being promised has NEVER happened!

I used to think British Gas was a brand to be trusted and to be honest many years ago it probably was but now it is a company only interested in taking your money and providing an unprofessional and unsatisfactory service in return. I will never use them again.

1,"            We replaced our old boiler three years ago with a new boiler from British Gas. The old boiler was in working condition and gave us no problems but we decided to change for energy efficiency. Ever since the change to the 330+ boiler we have been dogged with problems and breakdowns - indeed we are sat in the freezing cold whilst writing this review. I have grown to expect the next problem from the boiler and am considering whether to write off my investment and change this rubbish boiler again with a supplier I can trust. In my opinion, avoid this supplier.

1,"            Oh my god - and please excuse my profanity I certainly do not wish to offend anybody but have I ever had to deal with such levels of incompetence. It is no wonder that all of their engineers have to be registered Gas Safe - is their such an accreditation for them as a company - because if there is they would never achieve it. I have never had to deal with such an unforgiving, selfish, uncaring, doesn't give a sh1t attitude of an organisation. They would rather have vulnerable people die in the cold and put profits before lives before doing anything, now that's after charging you a handsome fee for installing the crap systems they put in then give excuse after excuse not to put it right. I am so infuriated with them I cannot even begin to write about what has brought me to this point - a bit like the crap boiler they have installed I am seriously overheating!!!Just look up the managing director online you will get his email and direct phone line - maybe he will listen - because he must be proud of what he represents. You spend millions on phoney advertising claims enticing people in then once you have them - bang!!!! the impact you have on their lives is devastating a bit like a gas explosion!!! How the advertising standards agency lets you get away with it I really do not know. Shame on you British Gas - you are a disgrace - I would rather use cow dung for my fuel and heating needs than use you but I have no choice!!!!

The Electricity switched fine took approx 3 weeks 18th July signed up switched 8th August.Gas we are still waiting for Bristol Energy to get hold of the supply from British Gas. British Gas initially denied the transfer, then transferred the wrong supply (erroneous transfer), now Bristol Energy have put the switching date back 3 more weeks and told me the tariff I signed upto is no longer available. I will be put on a tariff which is over 10% higher.The process has been a nightmare, I have been shafted by British Gas because I have been left on their highest tariff for 4.5 months and Bristol Energy, who are no longer offering the tariff I signed upto.The switch has already cost many emails, telephone calls and probably about £70 in lost energy savings.Now you know why people are afraid to switch!

1,"            I have (or had) warm air gas central heating and last November (2015) the boiler pilot light went out and I called in Homecare 100 (British Gas) - big mistake! The engineer lit the pilot light and the boiler fired up no problem and that should have been the end of it. But the engineer asked to go up into the loft and I stupidly let him. When he came down he said there was an asbestos flue up there that had no support and it had collapsed. Poppycock! It was in perfect condition last time I was up there which was the week before.But the engineer insisted it had collapsed and he was trying to save my life. More poppycock because I have gas and carbon monoxide detecters so i would know if my life was in danger. I am not stupid. But he shut down the boiler anyway with a safety warning notice and tried to sell me a new boiler for about £12,000. And when I asked him if it would support the warm air system he looked puzzled. He didn’t know the boiler was a Johnson & Starley warm air system.He then asked me to phone his sales people to arrange a whole new central heating system with radiators at a cost of about £7,000 that I couldn’t afford. It was all hard sell.A couple of weeks later I was in hospital and came home to a freezing flat with only a halogen heater to heat the sitting room. I have since bought a DeLonghi radiator which keeps the sitting room warm but the rest of the flat is freezing and God knows what my electric bill will be.British Gas charged £100 excess for its negative (more like a sales pitch) Homecare visit – I would give Homecare a wide birth. Reply to Jamie at British GasHi JamieI never said  the flue pipe collapsed because it didn't so please stick to the facts!  The Homecare engineer said the flue pipe collapsed then tried to sell me a whole new system which is why I don't trust Homecare. And you do not offer a number of quotes because i was only offered one quote only and that was British Gas at a cost of £7,000.

1,"            Absolutely the worst gas supplier I have ever been with.  Been with them since 1997 and stayed loyal all these years.  Unfortunately was made redundant in 2013.   Finally started working end of 2014.  I tried not to use too much gas until this year I went £160 in debit.  They hounded me like I was a criminal,  I paid what I can, British Gas didn't bother to look into my needs as a person with a disability.  Next they entered my house with a warrant to fix pre payment meter and snapped the court cost on top bringing my account to over £500 in debit. I sent endless emails and complains nothing been done. I have the pre payment meter which I hate.  Limited choice of shops to top up the card in my area.  Now I have a pre payment meter that doesn't work and no heating to my home.  I am appalled with British Gas service.  Stay away!

1,"            Utterly useless!!Been with British Gas for many years and the service has got significantly worse in the last few yearsThey don't employ enough service engineers to be able to carry out contracted annual services on time. My service is already three months overdue. The same thing happened last year. Not surprised to have Just received a phone call cancelling my service due in two weeks due to engineers 'prioritizing' emergency work. Do they have emergency work two weeks overdue? If so I hope I don't have a breakdown. They are very happy to take customers money but can't provide a service on time or a decent breakdown response. It is very frustrating trying to deal with customer service advisers they don't seem to appreciate or care that British Gas are compromising my family's safety by not maintaining my boiler, Causing considerable inconvenience and expense by constantly and cynically cancelling customers appointments. I'm not prepared to have my appointment rescheduled yet again taking more time of work in the knowledge that it will probably be cancelled. I'm sick to death of wasting time and money with British Gas so will be cancelling both my fuel and service agreements with them.

1,"            Just had my lasted boiler service renewal quote. At nearly £300 it represented a 43% increase over 2 years despite only 1 call out in that time. I cant see the point as I would still have to pay £50 on top for any call out. Called to cancel and get offered 15% discount straight away. This very generous offer would have reduced the increase to a mere 28%. So I cancel anyway as most companies, including BG!,  offer the same service for £120 for new customers.The policy seems to be to hike up the price by over 20% each year and hope that not many people notice and leave . Offer a 'very large discount' to anyone wanting to leave which still leaves them with a significant price rise overall. Then spend lots of money, by hiking the prices for loyal customers, on adverting and offering discount to new customers to replaced the ones they have lost

1,"            We've been loyal customers of British Gas for many years, but now I would rate their customer service rating as 1 star or even less.  After eventually getting through to the British Gas Call Centre, I tried booking a routine service for our boiler, earliest they can fit it in is January 2017 (Just a routine service ?)Also tried to book a Powerflush for our domestic central heating system.  Promised phone calls back not received, excuses that systems are down and that notes would need to be left with colleagues handling that side of the business.  Tried E mailing off from the British Gas web site, received a standard E mail acknowledgment,  but that was it, no follow up received, still waiting almost a week later. British Gas's customer service has been relocated to India as far as I am aware.  Feedback from British Gas Engineers I have talked to reveals that they are idle a lot of the time after having jobs cancelled during the day by this India based customer service department who quite honestly don't appear to have a clue,  that's my assessment.   Seriously thinking of moving away from British Gas if they don't get their act together soon.

Cannot understand their bills, cannot have a sensible discussion with them - they just ignore any reasoned argument over a bill and trot out standard phrases in the hope that you will go away. I have better things to do than get wound up by them, so I will never ever have them supply my energy again.

1,"            Our central heating system broke down several days ago. As a result of this we have had no heating, no hot water at all and cold water only available from the kitchen tap. Having seen British Gas TV ads we wrongly assumed we'd get reliable service. My husband booked an engineer's visit and received a text to confirm. He booked time off work and waited and waited and waited. No one turned up. Eventually after contacting British Gas via online live chat and a couple of phone calls he was told that the engineer wouldn't be coming. He was oferred the option to rearrange the engineer's visit for another day (meaning at least 3 or 4 more days  without water and heating) without any guarantee that the engineer would definitely turn up this time as other emergencies might again take priority. It is absolutely disgraceful to treat your customers like this. Not only do you not turn up to do an emergency repair but you don't even bother to inform the people waiting for you. We were going to take up boiler cover and maintenance with British Gas and were thinking of having the boiler replaced by British Gas, we certainly won't be using British Gas for these. In fact we're going to change to a different supplier for our gas and electricity. We don't want to support a company that has no respect at all for its customers.

They tell me the bill was £388 for a period of about 6 weeks, from 3rd March - 18th May (2015). I have not heard from them personally but decided now I am a bit more mantally stable I would contact them. It was ridiculous, absolutely no interpersonal skills, no ability to go off script.

Called again - was told the actual name of the plumber coming  and that he could call up yo midnight! ( no show as yet). On each call I explained I care for a frail, vulnerable 92 year old with Alzheimer's so I really do need the water to be working so I can dry up the flood on the kitchen.

I contacted their centre and was told that these bills are ""generated"", meaning that based on a few details a computer works out how much it can rip off a customer. Well BG, FYI, computers are programmed by HUMANS! Garbage in - garbage out! And BG came close to losing a time-served customer. 2 alternative quotes were far more reasonable than BG, and after making my opinion heard I was given a quote which was acceptable. Now you know how BG can pay their CEO £3million a year, indulge in glossy advertising, big corporate entertainment etc, and pay their shareholders a snazzy dividend every year!  BG - here's an idea:  instead of trying to rip off your homecare customers, try positively engaging with them by using human beings - not tacky technology. PROOF BG DON’T TAKE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY!! . Just had my 2017/18 quote and it’s a staggering 21% up!! Just who do they think they’re dealing with? Wilbur the furry penguin? Clearly, the mythical “Jamie” or whoever replies to Trustpilot reviews must be a penguin because they’re disregarded in their entirety.  If you need boiler cover I suggest you go to a competent organisation with a customer focused business model - not these money-grubbing penguin lovers at British Gas.

He said i would receive quotes in the post for these, which i did. I decided to go for both and the magna booster would be really beneficial for my boiler. I followed instructions on quotation letters and called the tel number given 0800 072 5410 I spoke to a young welsh lad, who didn't seem to know what I was talking about so I asked to speak with a manager, which took some time to do and who gave me some cock and bull story about the upgrade dept moving buildings at the moment so nobody available to take my call and she wasn't going to budge or had no product knowledge when I pressed her for info re quotations. All she could offer was to offer someone to call me back within 5 days re this. As you probably guessed... nobody ever called and these quotations expire, which is explained in correspondence. I have now missed the boat so to speak regarding these upgrades, the magna booster being really beneficial for my boiler and to prevent sludge etc from heating system going into boiler. They are probably making so much money that nearly £550.00 is pennies to them, however doesn't help me or my boiler/ heating system? Very poor customer service British Gas. Thank you!

After 7 call outs and 4 different engineers, I am now waiting for a part - which apparently takes 10 - 12 days.  That particular part is one which the last engineer broke while trying to replace another part.We are a family with 2 small children, one only 10 months old.  According to the customer services, we would only be a priority if the baby was under 6 months.  They managed to drop off a small portable heater last week, but I have had to go out and buy 3 more.My complaint has been escalated, yet no-one has bothered to call. I have asked for a replacement boiler since there have been so many problems, but British Gas (even though the agreement says they will replace if not working) can apparently take as long as they like before they deem the thing unrepairable!   The level of service and support has been absolutely shocking - with temperatures down to below zero at night and they are not interested in the slightest.

1,"            I started as a British Gas Business customer 3 months ago on the fixed 1 year contract rate - 21p/day  standing charge ( I'm paying for the privilege of having their smart meter on my property - I don't want it and I didn't ask for it ) - 16p/Kwh and billing on a quarterly cycle. The initial agreement was handled by an English person in an English call centre. I received a bill after the first month - something wrong here. I waited for them to call me, which they did from South Africa. I've nothing against south Africa or its people but when things go wrong it doesn't inspire confidence being called, by someone who has no authority to change anything without going to speak to their manager every five minuets - half way around the world. I did pay that bill over the phone but I also questioned the billing cycle and was assured something would be done. Two months later I have two more bills calculated at the higher non contract standing charge rate. I talked to South Africa again a month ago, more assurances that my billing cycle would be put right but it obviously hasn't been. I called the British Gas Home customer services number today and asked to be put through to the UK Based business customer services, she agreed without any caution and then I find myself talking to south Africa again - the very friendly guy said there are no UK based business call centres. I went through my last three months bills again, pointed out the incorrect billing cycle. He conceded, went back to his manager twice, assured me it would be changed to a quarterly cycle. Next up I suggested that the standing charge daily rate might be wrong and was assured I was on the correct amounts according to the agreement. It was only later on when I pressed it by going through the maths - 30 times £0.20 is around £6 for the month - not £16.43 as on the bill, that he admitted that both the KWh rate and the standing charge rates where wrong. Apologies, assurances another 10 mins wait and I'm back in England to another guy in the UK call centre that I am told doesn't exist! Start the story all over again. More apologies, assurances. I corrected him in his terminology, no this isn't a contract I agreed with British Gas, Its a contract between myself and British Gas and THEY are in breach of contract! I will wait another 5 days now to see if they call me back with an update. No one knew initially any details about my contract. Apparently the Thick Meter determines the billing cycle and mine thinks it is monthly - THAT is how the call centre people know anything about my account, by looking at what the meter tells them! The S Africa call centre has no control over the meter, the UK call centre which is rolled out when backs are against walls, does have control over the smart meter and can send people out to fiddle with it on prem or remotely.Apparently I have agreed to a one year contract and there is no way out unless I shut down my business. I am considering just paying their £6 a month to have a 'smart meter' (shouldn't they be paying me rent?) - and switching off the supply, swapping my fuse box over to an inverter/battery bank and two 250Watt solar panels - I am sat here trying to set up a computer repair business, I have a laptop, 3 fluorescent tubes and a soldering iron. Sometimes I turn up to 3 desktop PC's for a few hours. There is no heating (gas) and I wouldn't like to try heating this huge open plan 3 story shop on electricity. A laptop and 3 bulbs! What could be simpler! Apparently, not setting up a small business in the UK because the government sold us out to European parent companies/Leviathans (Centrica?) who outsource labour to cheap countries and try and gut (that was actually a typo but its worth leaving) their customers to self manage on the Net! I wonder how much interest they make collectively out of over payments made by 'mistake'!!!Ok, 5 days later and British Gas have been in touch with a phone call, an email and six updated bills - it now seems I am £46 in credit :) At the moment I feel like all's well that ends well and at least they sorted it out in the end.

1,"            7pm on a Friday evening, I phoned for an emergency appointment as I had a leaking water pipe in the house. I told the operator I had a 3yr old child and a heavily pregnant wife at home so he advised me to shut off water and an engineer would be out within 2 hours. I phoned 2 hours later and was advised engineer would be out soon. I reminded the operator that I had no water to cook, drink, wash or flush toilets. At 1230 am I still had no contact from BG or any engineer. I called back and was told the engineer who had been allocated the job had rescheduled it without informing me. I was told I should expect an engineer the following day. An engineer finally arrived at 1130 am on the Saturday. 15 hours without water after being promised an emergency appointment.Absolutely disgusting British Gas!I have switched to another company for £114 per year as opposed to £500 a year for BGAS.

They told me they had booked an engineer to come and fix the issue that same day as we have a new born baby - well you guessed it no one came and the 24 hour support number they gave me is in fact an automated voicemail saying the office is shut... avoid at all costs if you have little ones to think of!

1,"            I have been a British Gas customer for 40+ years, the service is going from bad to worse. We have a Home Care plan with them and pay monthly, to provide a annual service to our boiler. Each year we have to book up an appointment to get boiler serviced, we get a date and time slot for this to be carried out and arrange time off work to be home when engineer is booked to attend. Then either the day before or on the actual morning of service they phone to cancel (due to high volume of call outs!) so you have to make another booking. If you are lucky it's 6 - 8 weeks later then they cancel this rebooked appointment to service boiler again. This happen last year as well, so in the end you are lucky if they service the boiler once in 14 month or even 18 month period. Annually to me is once a year, i.e. within a 12 month period not 14 0r 16 or more months. I spoke to a couple of my neighbours who has informed me the same thing has happened to them, so they cancelled their Home care contracts and got local plumber/heating engineer to do, I think I will be looking to do the same, if the engineer doesn't come tomorrow as previously planed / re-booked appointment. Takes your money but doesn't provide the service.

5,"            My elderly bed-ridden mother has needed the engineers out on a number of occasions in order to deal with her ageing central heating system. On each occasion she has been given priority as a vulnerable person. The engineers have always been very courteous and efficient (in particular Dave & Kevin) and they have all gone out of their way to rectify the situation. I have no hesitation in thoroughly recommending HomeCare to anyone who wants peace of mind.

1,"            We had an engineer out last week who said there were 2 problems with the boiler one was covered the other was not.  My husband and I were in shock as the reason why we pay for such cover is so we don't get unexpected bills.  We were also advised if we don't get a magna filter fitted in addition to the heat exchanger then when more things break due to the same problem we would not be covered and they would break.  We explained that we needed to think about it and see if we could get a cheaper quote etc. The engineer said we would be sent out a quote. This wasn't originally sent when I rang the call centre regarding this they were unable to contact their own engineer to get this sorted out.  When the engineer came back out I was able to ask him myself about the quote and he sent it then.....if we had received it sooner we would of liked to of tried and get all done at once.  So that was the first part of the issue with the call centre being most unhelpful.Today I tried to get the worked booked in.  They are unable to book it in as we have received a quote and need to wait up to 48 hours for a call back!!!  I was told as there is a magna filter involved it is classed as an upgrade despite of us not having fully functioning hot water and needing a heat exchanger too. I explained to them its still same as a breakdown as hot water isn't working properly and I have my young niece staying with us along with my own personal health issues, but they still would not help. So thats 48 hours plus whatever time wait there is for an engineer booking slot.  Not only do we need to organise time off work to get someone in, we also have to wait 48 hours plus the time to wait for a booking. It makes you wonder why are we paying for such a poor service.  The call centre staff cant even pronounce your name.  They have my husbands name down wrong and although I have corrected them they haven't amended it.I recommend if you are considering which service provider to go with don't go with British gas we will be seriously looking into other options for the future and spreading the word.

1,"            Appalling service, to have to wait 5 days for an engineer for a repair only to have it cancelled by a Marc Walker who was obviously reading from a script and couldn't care less. I had taken time off work for this, so money lost!!! I asked to be put trough to his supervisor, but was fobbed off by him saying they would call back. They didn't, I had to call them ,  this time I got a polite lady who was actually apologetic and got it re booked, but that's not the point, they should keep their appointments . I was also told that they were snowed under with work,. When the weather is so mild that is somewhat unbelievable, more to the point I imagine they don't have enough engineers. Unlikely to renew with them, there must be better organised companies out there who actually want the work and who can provide a good service.

2,"            We have been with British Gas Home serve 400 for 10 years and seen their service and attitude drop considerably in the last year.Current issue it we have a gas cooker with an oven not working. This cooker has been down for over weeks and still not fixed.The first engineer that came with the part said he cannot move the cooker because it was too heavy and need a second person and left. My wife of 8 stone has moved it several times to clean around it. Since then it's been one excuse after another as to why they cannot visit. On two occasions they just did not turn up even though they were logged on the system.They gave us an ultimate promise that they would turn up today before 1pm and fix it. it is now 2pm and nobody has turned up and no calls from customer care.British Gas are happy to collect your premiums efficiently on a monthly basis but not interested in delivering against it.Put in a formal complaint a week ago and not heard anything there.It think it's time they were sold of to a foreign company like most of the airlines for us to get the service and customer care back to where it should be.Anybody new considering British Gas avoid. Just get to know a couple of good engineers privately and do it that way. We wont be with them for long now.Update: We just had a call from customer service this afternoon to say that they have had other emergencies and will not now get to us until next Monday. So since we first logged a call it will be 5 WEEKS before they are going to look into this. Nobody at British Gas will take ownership of this. They will not give us any names of people in charge. We speak to a different person every time. This time they aid that they would 100% attend and didn't. How can you trust them. By the way they are still taking my monthly payment out on time. We have taken off several days from work in additional. TOTTALY DISGRACEFUL, they should be ashamed of themselves. Definitely should take the British off British Gas and call themselves Incompetent Gas Ltd I say.  Matter still unresolved 5 weeks on.

So I complained, what a waste of time they sent me an email eventually but weeks have passed and nothing more, they just don't care. I got sick of waiting for a reply so I called the freephone number again this time waiting in the queue eventually getting through, I got an appointment in Jan 17 and was told it would be confirmed in writing but no confirmation has been forthcoming. So I have complained again but am not holding my breath for a reply. Now I am looking for someone else to cover my Boiler when this current contract expires in May 17.

Despite launching multiple complaints none of them could be found on my records.I now have a £334.92 debt on the account and they will not allow me to change providers until i have cleared this debt, in which case my debt is going to continue with bg as they will not change over my provider despite myself offering to pay using a direct debit however i can set up a direct debit but cannot change provider. BEING HELD OVER A BARRELL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!i am now being told that i have to clear the amount in full before they will allow myself to change providers.ILL TELL YOU WHAT BRITISH GAS ILL JUST PULL £335 FROM UP MY BACKSIDE TO PAY YOU SHALL I!!! Just to make things a little clearer my partner works full time and we have 3 children 2 under 2 and i am a stay at home mum to avoid childcare costs, do you think i have a spare £335 knocking around!!! To make things a little more clear british gas want to charge me £105 a month for my electricity usage despite us living in a new build and being out 50% of the time. Sounds like excellent value for money!!!And as a footnoteYOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DIABOLICAL!!!!I have spent 3/4 hours on the phone to yourselves over the past 2 days trying to come up with a solution!

To cut a very long and frustrating story short, both she and I have contacted BG several times about their erroneous debt claims which was then pursued by a UK debt collection agency who were acting on the part of BG.  After several conversations with incompetent and ineffective BG staff based in South Africa who acknowledged that there had been a mistake, we eventually got through to some very rude UK based operators who were more concerned about communicating BGs protocol rather than my ageing friend who is now suffering from anxiety as a result of being harassed by debt collectors.  There has been no apology even through the incompetence was on the part of BG.  The reliable BG of old is now a distant memory - at present BGs service deserves no stars which I would have chosen if it was possible.

1,"            Happy to take your money, but passing the buck in their organisation.Our boiler started working intermittently on Thursday 3 November. We have a 3 year old and and 18 month old in the house. We reported it on 3 November. The first service visit as arranged for Saturday morning 6 November. They called and rearranged for visit later on Saturday. A very arrogant over-worked employee (number63327) arrived at 22:45 saturday evening. He apologised. His diagnosis: New PC board required. It would be sorted on Sunday 7 November. Sunday 7 November we received a call from an assertive gentleman from British gas to hear if anybody in the house was in MORTAL danger due to lack of heating.  I insisted on having the heating fixed as agreed on Sunday. He apologised, it was not possible. He apologised again Possibly monday he said, but did not note this on his system. I specifically asked him to note for the engineer to bring the the required PC board with him.I called British gas on Monday to 7November to hear when the engineer would arrive. He was not coming. There was nobody available. The kind lady apologisedAn appointment was arranged for Wednesday 9 November. The engineer arrived on time. Without the required part. He apologised. Nothing about bringing a new part.  The engineer stated that he was sent home early the previous day. They did not have any jobs for him.The job is scheduled to be completed tomorrow. We have not had hot water and central heating for a week, yet British gas gladly takes money off my account every month and increase my premiums.This is a company where employees do not care, do not take ownership, do not take ownership, do not hold up their end of the agreement and apologise alot.Update:14.11.2016Yep, they do apologise and apologise, but cant fix things. The engineer came out a week ago, replaced the wiring cable and the PC board. I wasnt home, but gave specific instructions that the downstairs showers on the other part of the combi unit should also work. Regretfully, the shower doesnt work in the annex. I called British gas again immediately and they rescheduled an appointment for 15.11.2016. Two weeks without hot water from my shower. I specifically asked the engineer why they needed to replace the parts, Something caused it. His answer: 'Boilers break',., 6 days after he replaced the PC board and wiring harness, the boiler is on the blink again. Luckily the engineer is coming out tomorrow, again for the 4th time. I guess boilers do not just break. They break for a reason and the engineers have not been able to establish the underlying cause of the problem. The seem not very competent in fixing my boiler.And please British Gas, Don't tell me again you are sorry. FIX MY BOILER, So i have a warm house and warm water without the intrusion of your engineers.update: 15.11.2016The heating is still not fixed. British Gas service manager will call. Despite the heating not being fixed the took £50 excess on the insurance policy. I asked for my money back but the person at customer care flapped and said he's not authorised to do it. Waiting for the service manager to call.Update 25.11.2016It appears that the engineers have misdiagnosed the fault in the boiler and replaced spares that were not necessary. Two new PC boards and a new wiring harness. When the I called the engineer after the boiler malfunctioned again on 21 November the engineer said my system would not be covered anymore and hung up.An engineer came out that evening and finally, after 3 weeks identified the fault. Perished vacuum pipes.An increase in premium due to their engineers incompetence is surely on the cards. Time to change providers.

After we took out cover and our initial boiler service was carried out the boiler stopped working and we had to wait over 2 weeks to get it back up and running, partly due to an engineer canceling a visit on the day, after the time slot we had booked had begun and my boyfriend had stayed at home to wait in for the engineer! Heating eventually fixed and issues regarding that resolved. I had really wanted to cancel whilst we were in the cooling off period as I was so unhappy but we decided to stay and to get the free gift. A month on nothing had arrived so we queried it and were told there was no record of it and we would not be recieving the free gift which was the reason we chose British Gas in the first place and the reason why I didn't cancel at the start when we were having problems! Absolutely disgusted with the way we have been treated as new customers and I will not be renewing at the end of our contract or recommending it to anyone (I will be actively discouraging my friends from using British Gas)!*** Update***Despite the British Gas comment below this was not resolved and I still feel the same - my advice is still to avoid British Gas especially if an introductory offer is swaying you towards them as they may not honour it!***Another update***We have received the items which were offered as a free gift which was all we were after in the first place, took a long time and really an unacceptable experience but it has been resolved now.

And then when I didn't FINALLY receive my bill, they then had the cheek to phone me EVERY DAY, sometimes twice! How they get off thinking that it's acceptable to make me wait 3 months and then be that impatient themselves is beyond me.

1,"            I am extremely disappointed British Gas.I spoke with a rep and booked in a boiler check, I specified the morning and was advised that this would be between 8AM - 1PM. I specifically asked if I could have the earliest slot possible. While, I understand, that it's not always possible to provide the earliest slot, a note was made on the account for the engineer to get to my property as early as they could. No updates during the day to see if I could get an estimate of when the engineer would arrive even when I followed up.  At 2:15PM, I get a call stating they are on their way.  By this time I had left my property having wasted half a day for nothing.I complained to British Gas and they took weeks to investigate and get back.  End result was that they could rebook and hopefully the engineer would turn up this time.Rubbish customer experience an service.  Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere!

1,"            We have been loyal homecare customer's and pay £30.00 per month to cover our central heating system and boiler. Our boiler has been serviced  and we have been having a drop off on heat to hot water (due to heat exchanger failing). Despite being covered for parts and labour under the homecare service contract ... apparently this part and labour repair is not covered?? The same problem occurred several years ago and it was covered, and (based on where you live, and BG review of your boiler type, age and breakdown history, your new premium will now be £360.96)  So why all of a sudden is it not covered now, despite the new premium taking all past history etc.. into account??  The engineer said it was because we didn't have a recognised electronic scale reducer fitted... despite having an industrial (hotel) multi frequency electro/magnetic  scale reducer fitted to the rising mains unit for the past 15 years lol! (It's not approved by BG, despite the fact it/s working very well .. our taps do not get scaled up anywhere in the house). it would appear BG can wriggle out of any repair due to scale! We have just received a quote to repair the boiler and fit an ""approved by BG"" scale reducer for £807.37! which includes £480 for 5 hours labour! and £153.37 for the actually heat exchanger (incl VAT).  We are going to have to have this work done, we need hot water to stay hot and not run cold! But I'm not convinced we should be paying for it when we have parts and labour covered under HOME CARE!!!! (And have a scale reducer installed to protect the boiler) What exactly does homecare cover???I feel we have paid £360 for a £79.50 service as I see it !!! Funny they recommend we have a new boiler to replace our ""old"" boiler for more than £4400.00. We will be cancelling our homecare policy... I don't believe it is worth the paper it is written on, and if it doesn't cover the parts of the boiler most likely to break down it isn't much use and certainly does not give peace of mind!**ALL HAS FINALLY BEEN RESOLVED.... BRITISH GAS HOME CARE HAVE NOW COME BACK TO US TODAY... THEY HAVE ACCEPTED OUR LIMESCALE REDUCER AND WILL BE CARRYING OUT REPAIRS UNDER THE INSURANCE NEXT WEEK. .... THANK YOU BRITISH GAS WE CAN NOW SEND A SIGH OF RELIEF. We just wish you could have saved us all the heartache in fighting for what we knew we were covered for.. thank you **

They were taking up the spoil and lifting it over my car allowing the dust to fall on my car the idiots.

1,"            I have a service contract for my hot water/central heating and had a service visit from an engineer recently. Although I had booked the service weeks in advance British Gas called me to cancel the appointment the day before it was due to take place. As it is difficult for me to take time off work for these appointment I remonstrated and eventually they backed down and did not cancel. The engineer arrived and I left him to it. He could not get the central heating to work (I had not switched it on yet) and arranged a repair visit. The earliest this could be was five days following. When he left my place I found out that he seemed to have changed all the settings for the heating and hot water and he had done something to the hot water (which was working fine prior to his visit) to stop it working. As it was too long to be without heating and hot water I arranged an independent contractor to come out and he fixed the hot water first and the next day the central heating. I called British Gas to cancel their appointment and had to wait 20 minutes on the phone to speak to anyone. The representative I spoke to did not want to listen to feedback which I had for the company.

1,"            I guess British Gas is running out of customers and the only way they found to have customer is to replace the meter by a key box whereever they can.The first time I saw a key meter in my flat was in 2001. Fair enough, we were 6 people sharing a flat in London and we took turn to put money in the key meter.I did not know it still exist before I moved from London to Essex. Unfortunately, as I was about to sign the tenancy contract, I learned that the previous tenant did not pay their bill and as a result British Gas replaced the meter by a pay as you go box, leave the debt there.After having many problems I have already talked about in another review, I asked for a meter. As I haven't been their customer for long, I did not pass the financial check and I have to wait 60 days every time I want to make that request again.This is totally unacceptable to take me as an hostage. I rented in a 3 bedroom house and was paying £66 with Eon. Now I live in a 2 bedroom flat and I pay £110.And British Gas doesn't allow me to get a meter. One, they charge me more and second I cannot switch to another company while I have a key meter.They MUST BE SUED for this. SHAME ON THEMd1

1,"            Wanted to replace two radiators and add one into a conservatory.  Someone came to quote but said that one of the engineers would need to quote for the radiator in the conservatory.  Another appointment and the engineer came to quote, which I accepted.  Another appointment and an engineer then came to do the work but said that the planned position for the radiator was wrong.  It would need to go on a different wall where sockets were, and they would need to be moved, so couldn't do the work.  I had the sockets moved and re-booked an engineer for yet another appointment today.  The engineer did not turn up and after spending much of the afternoon on hold, being passed from pillar to post, I was eventually told that there was no trace of the booked call.  They said 'what made you think the appointment was confirmed?'  The fact that you told me, 'That's all now confirmed, an engineer will be with you from 8am on Monday 24th October'.  They then said you cannot speak to the right department, they are having trouble today - bizarre - someone will ring you back.  No one has rung back.  Hopeless.

I had to take the day off to stay home & be available. Nearly 7pm, no one turns up. I call British Gas, hold for 30 minutes & they tell me for some reason the appointment is marked as hold (because they didn't have enough engineers). And no one bothers to inform me. This is a case study on 'how not to serve customers and over charge them'. I fully intend to raise a compliant in as many forums/sites as possible.

At 1:15 I then contacted the via phone (had to wait 31 minutes for a callback as that was the queuing time) and also via twitter. I was then informed via Twitter the below:""Thanks for the details. It looks like the engineer was called to an emergency job for one of our vulnerable customers. As you were only booked in for a service you weren't classed as priority as you still have a working boiler. I've rearranged the service for 15th November between 8am and 12pm. ""The fact that they DID NOT call to cancel or notify me and I had to chase and then can only schedule for another work day is ridiculous. To expect me to use another one of my yearly holiday days once again for a service that may be cancelled again (without telling me).

1,"            We pay a mothly fee for a homecare service from British Gas to supposedly ensure that we have any issues with our bolier rectified quickly. Over the last 9 months we have had 9 engineers visit on separate occasions to be told that they are unable to diagnose and therefore rectify the same fault because it is intermittent. To accomodate the appointments I have had to book time off work which is inconvenient and costly. During this period of time we have received letters from British Gas threatening to take further action for the non payment of the £50 excess for the boiler repair. The same bolier that is still unrepaired 9 months on. Today my husband rang British Gas and was on the phone for 1 hour and 15 minutes. During this time he was passed to 4 different colleagues in 4 different departments. Each individual although polite said the same thing ""l am not authorised to make a decision on this and there is no manager availalable"". We were told we could make a complaint. We did this months ago and it took British Gas 4 days to respond to the email. The resolution offered to us was that British Gas would send an engineer out (that would be engineer number 9 and counting)We asked if we could have our boiler replaced as British Gas are clearly unable to fix it. We were told that yes this would be possible and that they would send us a quote so we could pay for it ourselves!!What is the point of paying for home cover if it is not refunded when British Gas fail to fulfill their contract? And at what point do British Gas come to the logical conclusion that it is cost ineffective to keep sending out engineers who are unable to resolve an issue?As a customer I have been more than reasonable but this unresolved situation is now ridiculous and intolerable. British Gas need clear processes and procedures in place with accessible and accountable managerial staff who do have authority to make common sense decisions.I can't believe the incompetence and poor customer service for such a large and supposedly trusted company.Update: the following day engineer number 10 failed to show up. A further phone call which lasted more than an hour and included being passed to 3 depts and being put on hold for 20 minutes resulted in us being told that there had been an emergency. No one could tell us why we had not been notified and when the appointment would be re-sceduled. There were still no managers available. We then received an automated call asking us if we would like to leave feedback. However when we replied ""yes"" we were told the service was out if order!! The manager that we were told would contact us definitely yesterday has still not been in touch. When I asked the employee in customer service today to comment on how he thought we had been treated I received a stunned silence. Even the employees are embarrassed at the service they offer.Time to contact the energy ombudsman I think.Update number 2 - we are still waiting to hear from British Gas. No one has contacted us after they failed to come out on Saturday and it is now Monday evening. We are also still waiting for the manager ""who will definitely contact you within the next 10 minutes"" to call us. We were told this 48 hours ago. British Gas you have the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with.

1,"            Having recently moved to British Gas from another supplier we were offered smart meters. So went online made an appointment, waited four weeks took a day of work and nobody showed up.I phoned them up and they told me a story of how appointments made online don't always go through, even through I had printed the email confirmation I received. Received no apology and was obviously unhappy that I lost a day of work but I agreed to make another appointment.Today after taking a day of work the engineer (who was meant to telephone first but did not) arrived; we live in a old town house with an inner hall, so left the front door open.I later discovered the engineer had walked into the hallway and simply left a card; I was in the sitting room next door but he didn't think to call or anything. I mean seriously the front door which faces onto a High Street was wide open it was clear I was in.Anyway I have now wasted two days of work waiting in for British Gas to fit there smart meters. I telephoned them and they couldn't careless and simply told me to make a third appointment in December (two months away). Not wishing to waste yet another day of work I told them not to bother.So I have now lost two days wages for nothing and would not recommend British Gas to anyone. I only switched suppliers due to the 'free electricity day' with smart meters and am now stuck with British Gas and don't even have the smart meters.As I am writing this just received an automated call from British Gas asking what I think of the service; quite unbelievable well they can read my 'feedback' here.

1,"            I never a nightmare as I have with British Gas, I have been happy for years with electricity readings and E.O.N. Unfortunately, when I moved, just when the key was handed to me, I learned that the previous tenant left with £40 debt, I had no electricity in my flat and no key for the pay as you go.The estate agent had tried to get a new key but there was no shop around with key as all the shops have been waiting for their orders for months. They had only card but I needed a key.Fortunately, the day I moved, I found a shop at my previous address which was able to give me a key even though they were not able to use the code British Gas has given to me. I had opened a new account and my account was supposed to be cleared.I called several times regarding the code and then I was sent a new key with a new code and few days later another new key with another new code. Nothing was working and I was not able to top up.Finally, the key manages to work and I started to top up. The first £20 were used within 3 days so I put another £20. The day after, when I came home, there was no electricity in my flat. What my neighbour explained to me later is what British Gas did to him. The previous tenant had left with some debt and British Gas is in the habit to get the debt from the new tenant, usually they do it little by little but in my case they had been to greedy and to obvious: they took literally £40 in 4 days.Because I was without electricity an engineer came at 11PM and replaced the box that was faulty. The day after, I had a key but I could not top up and because my account was so low, another engineer came to top up until I receive a new key with the refund.This engineer told me to use only one key and told me that the customer service could not send me some money. He said that he was fed up with the customer service that did not have a clue about what they were doing. They are sending you new key, give you a code, and nothing works at all.With this key I was able to top up but British Gas was still owed me £40.  When they sent me a code to get the refund, my key stopped to work. I went back to the shop to top up £10 as I was running low again but the key did not work anymore and I find myself not able to top up anymore.When I complained, they try to send me in a shop 5 miles away at 7PM on the evening. I told them I had no car and small children I could not leave alone but they told me that their request was really reasonable.They started to be rude telling me that I was difficult. I explained to them that they were still owed me £50 and that I was entitled to get them.After speaking hours and hours over the phone, telling me that I should not worry being running low, someone managed to find out that every times they were sending me a new key, they were using the serial number of the old box. And then they asked me to get a new key. I keep telling them that there is no key in the shop nearby but they don't come up with another reply.The electricity is running scarily low and they don't come up with solution, just saying that they are sorry for me and they are trying to find a solution.I have moved 3 weeks ago, I have spent hours over the phone and I am still waiting for a key that will work, the £50 refund and I don't know if I have few minutes or few hours left before I run out of electricity... I have never experienced in my life so much incompetence, I am just desperate to have to deal with British Gas. They should be more than ashamed of the way they deal with their customers. And the worst is that I cannot switch until I get a meter and they don't want to give me a meter even my credit score is excellent, they just force me to be one of their client and they give me a disastrous customer service.

2,"            Hello,I am taking this opportunity to complain about your billing department. We had the Hive installed in our property on 21/09/16. On the day of the installation the engineer called your call centre to arrange for a payment plan of 3 installments every 3 months. However now it seems you don't have a record of this and we have have received another reminder invoice to pay for the balance. I am not happy that you cannot honour the deal that we were given on 21/09/16. When I called you on 26/09/16 I also complained about the fact that my husband still does not appear on the account despite asking for this several times previously. However you were quite happy to take money off his account to pay for the Hive. Please add his name to the account : Stuart Weatherley.I look forward to your comments. Regards. Cecile Weatherley

There had been a small water leak in the loft, engineer said it was a simple repair as a joint had loosened.  4 days later the initial small leak (dripping) had become twice as bad with large damp patch appearing on ceiling.  Urgent call out arranged to visit that same day.  Waited in for over 4 hours only to receive a telephone call stating engineer would not attend for at least a further 2 hours.  Left house for precisely 10 minutes - the engineer called during those 10 minutes (2 hours early) and left a calling card telling me to re-arrange the visit for another day.  This was infuriating to say the  least.  Rang British Gas and a very helpful staff member rearranged the Urgent call out for the next day.  Engineer the next day was excellent - discovered that original engineer had made an inadequate repair by simply spreading a layer of glue over the leaking joint.  Unfortunately the layer of glue was inadequate and had missed part of the joint completely.  Leaking joint and section of piping removed by the second engineer and replaced.  All seems well and hopefully will remain so. Our only real complaint was the call out engineer arriving 2 hours early and he/she not attempting to ring mobile number to ask where we were.

Obviously we got a couple other quotes telling us contradicting information while we remained in contact with British Gas (3 quotes from you), but we felt BG gave us the best information.Now that we have agreed and paid a deposit we have been allocated a date of the 13th October and have been informed that we are no longer a priority customer.So we have gone from a friends priority customer, to we have your deposit and are happy to make you wait (5 weeks in total) without hot water or heating and told to complain if not satisfied.Following a written complaint, British Gas moved the date forward 3 days and their installation team did a very good job fitting our new boiler.

1,"            My 92 year old father needed to call Homecare because he had a water leak, the engineer arrived in 25 minutes, (my father is on an emergency list due to his age and the fact he is almost blind).The engineer diagnosed a leaking hot water cylinder, the cylinder was isolated which meant no hot water or central heating.  The tank was ordered and my father was expecting a reasonable fix time, especially as he was told by the engineer that if it wasn't for ""company policy"" he could buy one locally.Two days later another engineer arrived minus a cylinder, he was amazed that he had been called out considering that he had no cylinder but did back up engineer 1 in saying that he could get a tank off the shelf if allowed.I phoned Homecare on Friday 16th September and after a wait of 40 minutes was told that the tank had to be made as it was a 800 x 400 tank and not a standard 900 x 400.  I was assured that the tank would be ready for Monday 19th September and would be fitted first thing on the Tuesday.Tuesday came and no engineer or even a phone call.  I phoned Homecare again and after another long wait got through to an operative who said  ""I will check and phone you back"", needless to say after four hours I had heard nothing so I phoned again.I eventually got through to Homecare who told me that they had the cylinder, I of course said ""so it will be fitted this afternoon/evening"", not unreasonable I think as by this time my father had waited a week.  I was told it ""couldn't be done that day as it wasn't an emergency"".If a 92 year old waiting a week without heating and hot water is not an emergency then what is? The engineer turned up on Wednesday 21st September to fit the tank but unfortunately had to go for nearly 2 hours to collect a piece of copper pipe about 2 foot in length, what do these people have in their vans if not piping?All in all the service given to a loyal and longstanding customer is to say the least total rubbish but for it to happen to a frail old man is totally inexcusable and I frankly can't understand how any reputable company could feel that this is anything but diabolical service.  Surely management should have taken ownership of this problem before it reached such a point.Totally dissatisfied

1,"            I have been having problems with british gas since Sept 2015, I had debt with them so was put on a prepayment meter, however I called up 5/6 times to inform them that something is not right about my bill I am having to top up nearly everyday and this is causing me problems as I am a single mum and live on the 3rd floor with a toddler, I was told nothing is wrong with the meter or my bill etc, by the 6th time I'd called that is when my query was taken seriously and after making several complaints I was told that the billing department had been adding to my debt rather than taking away, apparently the system now shows my debt has been cleared. I am now in the process of complaining, after sending 3 emails to follow up my complaint about my debt being taken out after it is cleared, all I am receiving are stupid emails to explain that it is service charge that is being removed! No it is not service charge because it is nearly £4 a week!, I am currently still waiting to hear back from them after this I will surely switch providers as this is disgusting and unbelievable!

1,"            My problems with British Gas began when I discovered that after a year they had not set up my Electiricty account correctly and that I had paid a years worth of payements but they had never reconciled it against my usage. Their solution to that was to close my old (non-functioning account) and open a new one. Problem solved you would think...but no things actuallly got worse.. The action of closing my Electricty account has resulted in my Gas account details suddenly disappearing from my Online account. So now I can no longer see my gas or electricity billing details. Which is convenient for British Gas because at about the same time I was looking at my electricty bill I had raised a query with British Gas about the amount they were claiming from me for Gas. The amount being debited was disproportionate to my usage and I advised them to reduce it appropriately. Apart from an online acknowledgement that they had recieved my communication I never got a direct reply to that request.I've raised a number of online complaints regarding my loss of account information but no specific reply. The best respsonse to a query requesting an urgent escalation was a reply saying we're busy and we'll get back to you in 10 days and if your really stuck use your online account. Which is ironic because it is the issue of my online account not working which is one of the problems I'm complaining about.The entire British Gas customer operations department seems to leave me with a sense that it is in a state of permanent meltdown. Its staff seem to be unable to deal with non-standard faults or even to be able to respond timeously to straightforward queries. God knows how long this will take to sort out but I'll be damned if I'm going to continue to pay them monthly direct debits if they cant even be competent to present me with a properly reconciled bill.  This isn't the cheapest utility company in fact it may be the most expensive. Although your paying a premium for the pleasure of having British Gas as your provider please dont suffer from the illusion that your paying for a better service because you'll be disappointed. British Gas have a customer service problem. The sooner they recognise this and take actions to address it the better. The only way we as customers can cause this change in culture is by leaving and moving to alternative suppliers. Customer interest seems to be a a foreign concept at British Gas but maybe self-interest isn't.

We are now 9 months in and still not resolved, each advisor we have been put through to has been no help at all, Chris Lenard is one who has been no help whatsoever amongst many others. We have not paid a bill for 9 months and are expecting a big bill to pay and every 2 weeks we get letters stating that charges and debt collectors will be instructed. I find this an absolute joke that we have to chase our own supplier to pay there bills however we have had this much trouble. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay clear of this company and if you are automatically on British Gas when you move in PLEASE change your provider straight away as they have been an absolute nightmare and have just been a dark cloud over our head since moving into our property.

1,"            After closing our account, we were told we were nearly £250 in credit and that it would be refunded in 7-10 days. Called again today to ask why we haven't received it, to be told that apparently you have refunded it but you don't know where or who too! And that you also credited us £50 in August which we knew nothing about and have never received. To add insult to injury, we then get a automated callback asking us to rate you. I suggest you find and repay us ASAP and maybe then we'd be more willing to give you a decent rating!

1,"            I have homecare with British Gas and several months ago had 2 lots of £50 paid back to me due to engineers visits for which no works were carried out. I had paid the money then called British Gas and had the £100 refunded.They kept sending me invoices then saying I owed them £100 despite me repeatedly contacting them and each person I spoke to saying all the notes were on the system and I shouldn't have been getting the invoices - which were none too pleasant. I finally got a letter on August saying i categorically did not owe any money yet this outstanding invoice remains on my online account despite me repeatedly asking for it to be removed. Clearly there is still an issue and no one cares enough to sort it. I will be cancelling my services with this company.

1,"            I went on the Boiler Cover Plan Two and booked first annual service. During the inspection I was told that the boiler is not safe as there is a missing hatch to access the flue pipes and I need to fix it and give them a call when its done. Two days after, the hatch was fitted and I booked new appointment in couple of days. Next day morning while checking the BG mobile app I noticed that I'm not able to log in to my account.Called the customer service where I was told that my account, cover plan was cancelled due to the boiler not meeting safety requirements (access to the flue). There was no message, email notification send to me stating current situation !? How I suppose to know about it?After all my explanation that the hatch is now fitted customer service unblocked my account to the previous status and confirmed next day appointment.Next day morning on the arrival of the engineer I was informed that I'm not covered,.. my account has been cancelled and I will need to pay for any work!?? So once again I explained all the situation from the previous day to make this clear however engineer didn't even bother to care about it or to make any calls and check my account leaving me without explanation of anything.Another call to the customer service where they confirmed my account is active and engineer shouldn't do what he did!!?? They booked me new appointment few hours later leaving additional note to the engineer with the explanation of current situationNow, while awaiting for the engineer I was monitoring the status on the mob app where at some point I recognized that appointment disappeared from my account. .. it was basically cancelled!!Another call to the customer service and confirmation of cancellation as I refused to pay for the service?? No one even show up at my address , no notification was send and once again what payment if I'm on contract??Engineer completely ignored notes left by the customer service team regarding my account and the visit.For me it looks that British Gas engineers are doing what they want to do, they trying to act as account managers telling you what the status of your account is (without knowledge) trying to get extra £££ for the job they supposed to do. Showing ""I don't care"" attitude to the customer.New appointment is rescheduled for tomorrow Saturday morning hours, let's see how it goes!!For the time being contract with British Gas cost me full day off work awaiting for engineer as also my weekend plans of going away...had to cancel them due to new Saturday appointment.I don't really know where the problem is inside of BG but for me the engineers don't act professionally towards the customers and information is not passed as it should. They act as they can do whatever they want and treat the customer as they want. At the end it puts engineers in the bad view as it looks that they are trying to rip-off the customers.....(are they trying to reduce they own costs of spendings??? ) Who knows....not professionals for sure.Update after today (Saturday) appointment.The service received today from engineer Mark is totally opposite. From the beginning he explained all the situation how the cover work as also listen to my version of the story.He carry on with the inspection and boiler checks recognizing current issue. All work was done in professional manner explaining me everything whats where and why. His approach deserved 5 star feedback, so big KUDOS for it and thank you.At the end we could avoid all this situation if only Friday engineer will approach current issue in the same manner as Mark did.It would save a company time/money and unnecessary customer bad experience.

I have given a number of different meter readings and this has gone no where, I live on my own with my daughter in a 2 bedroom apartment and have been told my account is in £416.00 debit - ( This is whilst I have been paying my £79.00 a month) This has been going on for almost a year now, I have asked on several times to have my meters accuracy checked, which they said they are unable to do. I have been through Ombudsman services, who closed the case with an agreement of £134.00 debit on my account, As soon as they closed the case and sent out a finalization letter they decided to put my account back into arrears by over £400.00. Even though this is inaccurate, i have no choice but to pay this off, I am a single mother and cant afford to pay inaccurate debts. As soon as this is cleared I will be switching supplier immediately!!!

1,"            My mother lives on her own and to give her a bit of security (mistakenly) she decided to take out a British gas Homecare service contract, they have been out a few times, mainly to fix the appalling CH system they fitted 6 years ago that hasn’t done 1 years’ service without a fault! But this time they excelled themselves as they had convinced my mother over the phone to include her cooker on the service contract, even though she did not purchase it from them, so this year’s annual service arrived and they serviced the boiler? replaced a duff 3 way valve that had stuck even though they installed the last one only 3 years previous after it broke, then went to check the cooker, at this point the engineer condemned the cooker saying that the shut of valve was not cutting the gas off with the glass lid shut, she asked if he could repair it and the BG moron said that it would cost more to fix than the cooker was worth and British Gas charged £100hr so it was not worth his time! At this point somewhat distressed my mother phoned me to explain the situation, I asked the engineer over the phone why he could not fix it but moron gave no real explanation, I did point out that he was going to leave an 83 year old diabetic without any means of cooking until I could take her to buy a new one, but as far as he was concerned it was not his problem has was just going to disconnect it as it was not safe or repairable? at that point i asked him to cease work on the property and leave the cooker alone and I would deal with it, he said neither my mother nor I could ask him to leave as he had the “right” To disconnect it and if I got funny with him he would disconcert the whole house!! I will admit at this point I swore at him over the phone, but hardly surprising. The next day I asked a friend of mine who is gas safe registered to go round and check what had been done, firstly the British Gas moron had removed the bayonet fitting from the wall and blanked it off, not just unplugged the cooker from the fitting, as my friend pointed out this was somewhat unnecessary as it would have stopped my mother just installing a new cooker and was a little bit vindictive. So firstly he refitted the bayonet connector to the gas and then fixed the valve in the cooker that was merely stuck because the grease in the valve had become hardened, once free and correctly lubricated it was working perfectly and took him about 20 mins in total. He charged me £30 and said a new valve Hotpoint C00194435  would only have been about £15 trade. So a new cooker cost less than that does it British Gas?? This is a perfect example of the rudeness, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and total lack of customer care displayed by British gas to one of its elderly customers. Is it not bad enough that you fitted a CH system that had so many initial faults it took over a year to correct including the condensate drain fitted with a negative fall so it froze solid, radiator pipes that look like they were installed by a 5 year old, and TRV’s that stick shut that my mother’s arthritic hands cannot open again, but BG say not my problem. They really are the epitome of profits first customer second.

Washing machine faulty in June 2016, took 3 weeks to repair - a new drum ordered and fitted - despite my son having a medical condition which required full bedding washing daily and BG were aware of this.  THEN, the machine started to go wrong after the repair.  Got to the point where Aug 2016 it wouldn't work as it wouldn't spin.  Troubleshooting suggested a faulty drum...BG said we'd have to pay the excess again.  After I kicked up a fuss, they agreed that if it was a fault relating to the previous one, I MAY appeal to 'Billing' to have the excess waived.  Good of you, BG!So engineer booked in.  Engineer failed to turn up.  Phoned BG.  No explanation given for the no show......they didn't even apologise!  Offered me a new date a week away which I said wasn't good enough.  I was then asked in a VERY accusatory way why the first appointment was booked as an emergency?  Well, it's not me that does their internal grading - I don't work there!  Still no explanation given, no apology, so I asked to speak to a manager.  One would ring me back apparently, oh, and I was told I was rude.  Which I wasn't.  I'm good at being rude - I know when I am being!  I'm still waiting for a manager to ring me back, two hours later.  Half an hour ago I chased it up and was told a manager would ring me within 15 minutes......I still have no working washing machine, three kids, a pile of washing which includes a duvet, bedsheet, pillow cases, duvet cover, no idea when an engineer is going to come and repair it, and no idea when BG are going to call me back.......UPDATE:I made an official complaint to British Gas and since the review their service has been outstanding.  They phoned later that afternoon, arranged an engineer to visit the following morning, dealt with the rude staff member and provided further training, waived the excess fee and also issued compensation.  So it's one star for what happened prior to me speaking to a call centre manager, and five stars for what's happened since!!

I signed up over the internet and received all of the relevant paperwork and e-information to allow me to book the first service visit using the website.Unfortunately, having booked a visit between 12 and 2pm and receiving a confirmatory email that '...the engineer will phone you on the day...', neither of these things happened.  My first chasing call to British Gas took a whopping 12 minutes and the call centre operative was unable to contact the engineer to establish his whereabouts (so no resolution).  It was agreed that I would be called back, which I was, although this was simply to tell me that the engineer was running late (this had already been established beyond any reasonable doubt) and that I would have to wait for a further call from the 'planning team'. This level of service is really poor and the customer experience is just awful. Not only this, it's blatantly unfair to the customers to be treated in this fashion. Not at any stage was I offered either of the following1. A resolution to this issue.2. Recompense for having to wait in for the engineer.The troubling this is, is that I have to trust an organisation with this level of ineptitude to service my gas boiler. I may just think again.Regarding the response below from British Gas; If the engineer couldn't attend because of an emergency then why wasn't I called; also what wasn't the website updated, instead it stated that the engineer was 'on their way'.   I took an afternoon off work for this, which was a waste of time.

The next day they duly sent out an 'engineer' who had apparently never seen that type of boiler before. We explained it was going through all the normal motions and noises, it just wasn't lighting the pilot light. After much faffing about, draining the boiler, having a quick read of the manual etc, never actually looking at the flame ignition issue he duly announced (accompanied by the hilarious intake of breath through teeth) that it was more serious than just repairing it then and there as the heat exchange was cracked and he didn't have the part so it would be Monday morning and though he was allowed to order the part he wasn't allowed to book a morning engineer appointment in advance due to British Gas new internal rules but he had gone ahead and done it anyway he would get into trouble ...etc So Friday Saturday Sunday no hot water ...Monday morning the new engineer arrives, his opening line being 'i'll just check what needs doing' you have the part I explain, you know what needs doing 'yeah, but I don't trust him that ordered it' good start we thought.as it turns out, having now taken the day off work to be here so the new engineer could fit our new heat exchange part ...cause that's potentially dangerous.... watched the boiler come off the wall and be dismantled, that's not what's actually wrong with it....'it's your flame ignition system mate' says the new engineer, 'I havn't got the part' So now he's ordered the part we needed in the first place and a third engineer will be here some time during the course of Tuesday (another day off work) to fix the problem we told them it had on the initial phone call.

1,"            I am not impressed with British Gas at all.  My mum, who lives on her own and is in her 70’s was scheduled to have a new hot water cylinder installed followed by a power flush to the system the following day. The cylinder was fitted on July 20th – the hottest day of the year so far.  Just before the Engineer left her bungalow, he put the hot water and the heating back on to test the system was working.  Then when he left he turned the heating off on the controls on the wall and turned the thermostat down as low as it would go.  An hour later, the radiators were still belting out the heat so my mum called the Engineer on the phone number that he had called her on.  The phone kicked to voicemail so she left him a message explaining the situation and asked him to call her back so she knew what she had to do, but the Engineer did not call her back.  As it was too hot in her bungalow she came to my house.  Later that evening we took her home, the bungalow had cooled down enough for her to stay in it, the boiler had cut out and the radiators had cooled.  She went to bed but woke up around 11pm gasping for breath.  The boiler had fired up whilst she had been sleeping, the radiators were so hot that she burnt her hand on it. She then opened her patio door and sat by this until 4am trying to get her breath.  At 6 am she couldn’t stand the heat anymore and came to my house.  I rang British Gas to complain.  The Engineer came back to do the power flush and said that he made a mistake and left the system in such a way that the thermostat and the controls would have no effect on stopping the radiators heating up. A Complaint Manager rang to find out the details.  After having looked into it, he rang me back a couple of days later and  admitted that it was British Gas’ fault, that they were sorry and that as a gesture of goodwill they would offer my mum one month’s free home care plan – ie £15.42.  Can you believe the cheek of British Gas  - £15.42 for having nearly suffocated my mother?  I was told that I would receive this offer in the post and details of the Ombudsman should I wish to refer my complaint. That was over a week ago and I still haven’t received anything.

1,"            My elderly mother has just sold a holiday home due to poor health. We took meter readings prior to house sale completion and my mum called British Gas to give final readings on the day of completion. British Gas disputed these, it would seem because they had massively overestimated the bill for quite some time. This I can accept as the meter reading was vastly different to their overestimation. What I can't quite believe is that the customer service representative told my mother that she was wrong because they had already had the meter readings from the new occupiers and they matched British Gas estimate. This was a lie and in fact the new owners did not ring up their energy company until the following day and with meter readings and they matched the ones my mother gave in the first place. I'm just in disbelief they could make up something like this. British Gas have agreed to refund my mother now and I am sorry that despite our issue being resolved I have to leave this review because the customer service is so bad and I think have taken advantage of an older lady.17th September 2016 Thank you for your response Jamie.

In my job I have to work on large industrial ovens so I had a chat with the guy and asked if he'd checked whether voltage was actually reaching the fan he hadn't so we checked and it wasn't. I then said have you completed a wiring continuity check to the fan, he hadn't so we checked and the wire was broken somewhere. Eventually he found a ceramic resistor open circuit stopping the supply reaching the fan. At this point I left him to it then I heard a large bang and the guy had shorted the oven supply to earth blowing the supply fuse, he hadn't even switched the supply off to work on the oven. Once the power was back on he said the job was done so I checked to find the fan was now working but blowing far to hard at which point I asked what he'd done to be informed he'd removed the resistor altogether as it's only required as a frequency filter to stop interference on TVs, as we don't have a TV in the kitchen it's not required. I was absolutely astonished because in fact such resistors are used to limit fan speed which explains why the fan was blowing so hard, I explained this to him at which point he asked what I wanted him to do, replace the resistor I said. The resistor was ordered and eventually replaced and the fan ran at the correct speed and we didn't have to replace the whole oven.On another occasion we had problems with our central heating system which resulted in BG replacing the air separator. All this did was result in our central heating system becoming more noisy so I raised it with BG and another guy was sent around and all he said some central heating systems are noisy. I informed him that this system had been very quiet for the previous 30 years until BG fitted the new air separator but he wouldn't listen so it was left as is. The noise in our air cupboard is such that we are concerned about our grand children sleeping in the adjacent bedroom due to the noise so I've had to raise it with BG again.On another occasion I reported two faults but BG only passed one fault to the engineer who didn't have time to look at both.These examples of BG Homecare service raise serious issues as follows:1. How qualified are are some of the people BG send to your house for Homecare repairs if they repair by removing components which are required as part of equipment design. 2. How many innocent customers are out there with equipment safety compromised because a BG engineer has removed components because they had no knowledge of the functionality of that component or the implication of removing it. I suspect this practice is in conflict with the Electricity at Work Act.3. Has anybody been hurt or worse as a consequence of BG bad practice of removing components to affect repairs.4. How common are these type of experiences with BG Homecare products. From friends, family and work associates I've spoken to quite common.Whilst I must say that over the years some experiences with BG engineers have been first class but the above issues raise serious questions over the safety of some BG repairs.I've had a Homecare contract for many years due to working away from home and over the years the service has deteriorated whilst the price has increased. Perhaps it's time to start looking elsewhere particularly as I moved my gas/electricity to another supplier years ago due to BG excessive charges.

1,"            When we joined British Gas, we got quoted that our consumption of electricity a month would be £85 a month and that it would be a good idea to stick to a DD of £85 that way we may be owed money back at the end of the year. (All our power is electricity)Admittedly we lowered our DD for a few months to £70-£75 in the summer but the upped it to £95 to eventually £110!!!! To try and pay off our supposed debit amount! We have now moved to EDF and wish we had from the start, our remaining bill was for £216.73 and I think it's absolutely disgusting prices! We only have a two up two down!Shame on you British Gas, no wonder everyone is moving to EDF!! Not sure how you have any customers left at all!

Lied about raising a complaint - then closed complaint of as dealt with when it wasnt. Took £50 from my card as that was excess but work never carried out and still am waiting for money back months later.Have cancelled all my British Gas Services and have recomended family and friends to do the same

1,"            Been with British gas home care for three years. After 2 annual services without fail the boiler breaks down within 7 days. Each time the cause was a blocked condensate pipe which was ignored during the service visit.Home cares response? Pay us £50 excess or we cant repair it! Even though it was less than 7 days since the service visit.Finally agreed to revisit without charge but now have to sit here in a cold house till tomorrow though their incompetenceThat's the point in a preventative service if it doesn't even check the fundamental safe and reliable operation of the heating system? .Im checking into a hotel and posting my telephone conversation onto youtube Disgusting and negligent.UPDATE 25/012017BG came out to do the repair on Friday (20/01/2017)The engieer insisted that the fault shown on the display was indicating a flame problem not a blocked condensate pipe. My partner explained that he was wrong as we have had this problem in the past. He went out to the van, checked the boiler history on his laptop. He came back in and told us it was our boiler that was poor quality and again insisted that he needed to replace two more parts on the boiler.Once again the boiler fired up and he left.We are now on Monday 23rd just two days later and the boiler is again broken down and again shows the same fault ( F L) blocked condensate pipe) Tried to ring British gas and the office is closed till tomorrow.Yet another night without heating.Incompetence doesn't begin to describe it.UPDATE 10/04/2017Boiler broken down again, exactly the same fault as all the other times. Made to pay an additional £60 excess fee even though its only a couple of months since the last time they repaired exactly the same fault.

1,"            I paid our British Gas bill by an online payment  through my business bank account (as I have done for years) to the British Gas bank account; the transaction was completed on 27th June 2016. The following week we received a telephone call from British Gas and the caller was rudely insistent that the bill had not been paid and that he would 'give us until Friday' to pay the amount. I also received an email  on 7th July 2016 with an attached copy of the 'outstanding' invoice; I paid the invoice again. When I checked my bank statement, I realised that the payment had been taken twice and I rang British Gas to explain the situation and requested a refund. However, members of the customer service department would not accept that the payment had been made twice, so I offered to email a copy of my bank statement, so that the transactions could be verified. I have now been told that the statement is not suitable evidence and that I need to send a copy of the bill to prove it has been paid. I contacted my bank and they have informed me that this is not possible, because I made both payments online and that the transactions can only be seen there. I was also advised to ask my bank for an indemnity payment to have the over payment returned to my account, but that is not possible, because the transaction was not a direct debit. I have tried to explain all this, but the customer services agent over-talks me on the phone and his main point is to insist that no payment was made to British Gas on 27th June 2016 and effectively it is up to me to prove otherwise. However, he tells me my bank statement is not proof, that I must send a copy of the bill receipt, which I don't have, because I paid online...and so we go round again. My bank confirm that both payments were made to British Gas through my account, but British Gas will not accept that this is the case, even though my bank statement clearly shows the two transactions. This attitude is totally unacceptable and it is exasperating to try to talk to someone whose replies do not answer questions and just appear to be scripted responses to FAQs. Update:I have received a call to say the transaction has been traced. However, because our last meter reading was more than 28 days ago, I have to submit the latest meter reading to British Gas, who will deduct any charges from the over payment and will refund the difference to my bank account!Conclusion:British Gas do not make mistakes, any proof of error British Gas customers provide is wrong/unacceptable/not suitable (delete as appropriate), and 'apologies' are grudgingly made from a prepared script - which means nothing. I have absolutely no faith in a company whose attitude to long-standing, loyal customers is to refer their queries to a call centre employee and then treat that customer like some sort of fraudulent liar. It was my job to prove their mistake, not their job to investigate the problem. This customer is looking for a new gas supplier.

1,"            I have always used British Gas for my electricity and gas. As a home owner it made sense to use them for their home care services, I thought that I would have the peace of mind that if anything went wrong with my boiler, they would fix or replace. So I signed up for British Gas home care, boiler, electric and plumbing protection in October 2009.Everything went swimmingly, I had a boiler service each year and everything was perfect, until....In 2013 my boiler stopped working. I had no hot water no central heating. I had two children under the age of 5 years of age. I called upon trusty British Gas home care, to be told that there had been a problem with my direct debit and that I would have to pay £99 for a British Gas engineer to visit. I paid the £99, a British Gas engineer visited and wrote off my boiler. The flue had been leaking for 2+ years and had leaked into the boiler so badly that it had corroded the inside of my boiler deeming it irreparable. Bearing in mind that it had been serviced and deemed as safe after every yearly service.The kind engineer noticed that I had two small children in the home with no heating or hot water, one of which suffered from kidney damage and was registered under the children's hospital. This engineer called British Gas and arranged for someone to come and give a quote for a new boiler,A sales man came and gave a quote and left. I did not sign an agreement there and then, nor did I sign an agreement for British Gas to come and complete any work. To my knowledge my ex partner has been chased for a debt related to an installation of a boiler for £3365.62 for three years.AND NOW THEY ARE CHASING ME!I have contacted British Gas yesterday because they are now chasing me for this debt. Apparently they are now chasing me for this amount and have referred it to their solicitors because chasing my ex partner has ""proved  fruitless"" these were the exact words that they used.I can confirm, that I have never accepted the original quote that British Gas quoted me and that I never signed any agreement. I did not give permission for any work/ installation to be completed by British Gas. I did not sign for any completed work or boiler installation.

2,"            commercial business. Having started with BG for gas & electric 12 month ago.  We 1st started receiving FIVE bills per day for each fuel.  Once that had been put to bed, we started receiving 'demand' bills for a Mr K. Navidi and then most recently we have been referred to as a Mr S. Whyte by the meter reader who then explained after a lot of questioning, that he was unable to take the meter reading :-(Due to the time wasted and hassle this has created, we had informed them 3 month prior, that we are leaving - that email form and letter apparently were not received (but we did photograph that email form) prior to sending.  They have now placed an ""Objection"" to our new supplier which stops us from leaving.Phone after phone, Hassle after hassle after hassle with sweet sounding girls and promises of ""Objections removed"" on multiple occasions.Moral of this tail is ""unless you can afford to waste hours of spare time to sort out THIER mix ups with no compensation - we cannot recommend BG as an energy provider"".(Please be aware that BG was taken over by Shell a few month back, so we can no longer advertise ""Backing Britain"" in this respect either).

1,"            I am getting on a bit and moved into a Nottingham City Homes high-rise aided-flats.I set-up a direct debit to pay British Gas and almost a year later received a demand from them for another account number that had my name and correct address on it. Being partially deaf, I asked Deana, the warden, who contacted BG, and almost two hours later, they told her that this account would be closed on 7th June 2016.On the 7th of July 2016, another letter arrived asking if I had forgotten to pay this bill? Julie, the another warden rang them to try and sort this out, but it took so long, her going home time arrived. Seems I may have to pay to have the second (Non-existent) meter removed/disconnected?Four days later, I managed to get Deana to ring again. Eventually, again, they informed her that the account would be closed.I now wait nervously for the next 'Reminder'.Hey-ho!Well well well... The following Saturday (today)Oh, Marvelous! French Owned British Gas, who last week told Warden Deana the Electricity Bill would be scrapped for the second time, have sent me a Red Letter Bill with threats now!Losing me credit rating - demanding the £250+ I don't owe them!So frustrated, I did a post about them and put it on Facebook, LinkedIn and on WordPress too!So annoyed with them for lying to my warden twice now! Grrr!So, another demand arrives, and my aided-flat warden rang them again for me.Warden Deana told me once again, the account is to be closed and I have nothing to worry about. (Humph!)Now, a few days later today, I get another demand for this non-existent meter with my name on it, once again for the £250.32.""Call us about the money you owe"" is the headline on it!The replacement ticker the angina and sticking reflux valve are not happy with this extra unwarranted hassle from British Gas, especially after Deana rang them for I think the fourth time - now I have to bother her again for a fifth-time. After being told on every occasion the account would be closed.My health is suffering over this, and enough is enough! I will be seeking legal advice as recommended by the medical staff. When and if I ever feel up to it!All I want is peace and a hassle-free existence.Nemo Mortalium Omnibus Horis Sapit, I understand, but my patience is getting thin. I hope I don't snuff it before this is sorted.Where can I get some help on this, can anyone help?Thursday 28 July 2016:Warden Deana Walker rang British Gas again (Over an hour) for me.This time, a different story emerged: It appears the two tariffs are on the same meter now? They intend to merge the two - thus making my bill twice as much?This after being told three times by British Gas that they had closed this fictional extra account!Deana asked them to send someone out to sort and assess the situation.So, now I await Deana to have a look and then the BG representative getting in touch to arrange a visit...1220hrs: Ah, Deana is here now talking to British gas as she looks at the meter... She gave the all the details yet again to a different representative who told her the account in question was definitely closed 28th June 2016. This the same account that they are going to merge with my proper account???She was then put onto someone else and explained it all again to this one. She waited patiently for the return to the phone, of the lady she had been speaking to this time... 1240hrs: Still waiting.  1253hrs: Still waiting... 1258hrs... (Missed her dinner break now!) 1259hrs The Lady (Leigh) returned said Checked on company database, what Abdul told her earlier was incorrect, the account they were still sending out bills for no longer exists!Nice that! I await further developments with an uncomfortable feeling of dread in my old mechanical heart.Thursday 4th August:British Gas with another Red Demand for payment to the meter they told Warden Dean Walker a few days ago (For the third time!) had been Cancelled!The ladies must have seen how this affected me, and they ran Deana and asked her to call and see me once again Sort out this horrendous situation.This time, French-owned British Gas threatened me that they would get a legal entry warrant and replace the non-existent meter with a payment meter, I'd lose my Credit Rating, and they will pass on my details to Credit Collection Agency!British Gas with another Red Demand for payment to the meter they told Warden Dean Walker a few days ago (For the fourth time!) had been Cancelled!Warden Deana arrived a bit later, and took the paperwork, saying she is going to contact them by email this time, so she has a record, and off she went, too.Heard nothing back from her yet.Terribly worried now!Warden Deana came to see me.

(Oh yes, very confident about this we were!)Deana spent 53 minutes in total on hold - the poor woman had lost the will to live!Wednesday 10th August 2016:British gas, who told Deana five times at least now that the account had been closed, sent me an email request to supply them with a meter reading again, for the supposedly closed mystery meter!?!?It gets more convoluted and worrying as time goes by!Wednesday 17th August 2016:Despite having been told by Deana not to contact me, but her as she is my sole representative and her contact details being given to BG, they called me on the phone knowing my hearing difficulties. The polite gentleman, who's accent, I found extremely hard to comprehend, wanted to talk to me about the non-existent meter. I informed him of the arrangement for Deana Walker to be contacted as my agent. Then had to give him her contact details for the eighth time at least.Still, no more Red Letter threats and demands again... yet.19th August 2016:Got a phone call from BG again. Told them to contact Warden Deana. Later in the day - Well, fancy that, yet another threatening payment demand arrived! ""We will pass your details to a debt collection agency!"" ""...for a warrant to enter your property and fit a pay as you go meter"" Again I receive it on a Friday so I can worry and fret over the weekend before I can get to talk to Deana.The stomach ulcer has started playing up now. Tsk!Monday 22nd August 2016 - 0835hrs:Hobbled to the Community Hut at the flats and luckily, Deana was in, she called British Gas and asked if she could be put through to the complaints department, this time, she was told they didn't have a complaints department?She explained the situation yet again and I had to confirm my authorising her to speak for me. She was put on hold for fifteen minutes: She was put-on-hold again and eventually ran out of time and had to ring off after 20 minutes! She will try again later and let me know what occurs. Lots more to add, no room left

2,"            I decided to switch from BG in April 16 after having been a customer since 2009 due to the high price of the service and have now moved to a fixed tariff with another provider. I received correspondence from BG that the new provider would be taking over the contract and that they would close my account. Although there have been no issues with the electricity account there have been ongoing billing problems with the gas account. In May I received a final bill for £640 which was based on an estimate. When I gave the reading they confirmed that I owed £64. Has I been a vulnerable person I may not have been able to have discussed this with them. Today I have received yet Another bill for the gas account for £35 despite there having been three conversations over the phone in which the staff confirmed categorically that the account was closed and despite the BG app confirming the account was closed. I now have no option but to complain in writing as I amWasting time and money discussing the account over the phone and getting no where. They are completely incompetent and expensive. Avoid.

1,"            Shocking stuff from BG, I moved into a new flat which I was renting and took on an account with them as they were the current gas supplier. Big mistake.Not only finding them more expensive the service has been shocking. The previous tenant contested their bill and meter number with BG and was passed to debt collection services. I spent hours on the phone to them deciphering which meter was mine, running up and down stairs for them instead of them sending an engineer to do it. Then guess who they tried to collect the outstanding money off? Yup, me. The new tenant. Now I could forgive this happening once, having your details passed to a collection agency to collect debt that's nothing to do with you, which they fully know given my stair running. But twice? Months later? COME ON! Not only letters but texts as well as they passed on my phone number. Thanks BG! They know its not my account (different number) but keep adding my personal details to collect from the previous tenant. And then its my job, the paying customer to send letters back to the collection agencies and call them clear my name because of their repeated mistakes.Total farce dealing with them, both times ""very sorry, this should not of happened"". Really? You dont say...Useless

Then went around and checked all the appliances which I said was fine got to the gas it was working perfectly and went to put the hood down and pulled on it and it broke! So got on to his superior (Russell Brown) who said you have to cap the gas now as it operates the cut of switch. I spoke with the engineer who apologised and said his supervisor said they will fix it or replace it with a like for like product and pay you back for the food cost as you will have to buy take away. It can happen to anyone so I understood and finally after one week they offered to come and fix it or replace it.Two guys come and said it's not worth repairing as it's  to old so they will pay you for a new one! I then went back to Russell Brown and he said find a like for like which I said found one its £399 (New home Stoves gas cooker) his reply was it's too much I can only give you £250. That's when I got annoyed and said hang on your guy broke a perfectly fine gas cooker and its your responsible too replace it. Passed me over too there insurance centrica (who are a total bunch of t***s) who offered to pay only £100 and won't pay for any cost's incurred whilst cooker was broken.  It's now June 25th 2016 and still no reply just contacted the financial Ombudsman services and they advised send British gas another email stating what has happened and wait another 8 weeks then get back to us. I have been telling all my friends and family and advised them how annoyed I am it's unbelievable you would think a company this big that makes so much money would do anything to put things write but apparently not.

V.slight increase, but nothing as much. I accepted.Then I received documents in the post ..saying I'd ""downgraded"" however this isnt so as I have the same cover as last year&its called the same thing...so how can I have lesser cover. So I rang to confirm this and a man said I hadnt been downgraded, it was as I had thought and all was the same...except the price was lower than the original price.So, why on earth do BG think they can continually increase the price of their ""service""¬ give the ""best deal"" unless someone questions it???!!!

The date came & went and no visit from Britsh Gas, they couldn't even give a courtesy call to say they would not be coming. So the whole day wasted waiting around for them. Phoned customer care on Wednesday 15th June 16 and they could not give a reason for the no show. All they said was someone may have had en emergency when I asked what do they class as an emergency they said someone without heating, what in the summer !!!

1,"            We moved into a new rental residence that was previously being used as a commercial property.We stayed with our previous supplier Sainsbury Energy but was told that British Gas was the registered for the building and we need to liaise with them about the date we moved in.In brief, my wife spent several months explaining to them we have only moved into the property for 6 months and cannot be asked to pay for bill up to £2000 predating our move. In the end a sum of £310 was requested to cover some period of overlap and I made the payment over the telephone with their representative.They the gave me an authorisation code verbally and via email. We thought the case was closed but 2 weeks later we received a debt recovery document insisting we owed £310 to British Gas and that the recovery team will be planning to visit the address to recover sum to that amount.As a medical professional working full time, this came as a huge shock in view of the email confirmation we received and my wife felt extremely vulnerable as a young mother with 2 toddlers in the house.We tried contacting the complaint officer in charge of the case via phone and email several times but did not receive any reply or callback.The debt recovery team from British Gas did not believe our assertion that we have made payment until they checked with payment department and learnt we have provided them with payment details.We then had a very patronising person telling us that the authorisation code on the email is not confirmation payment is made and that it is our job to check with our bank to ensure the payment was made. We explained the process of paying by phone and the authorisation code received only to be put down with absolutely no apology.We have resolved the matter by giving them the same payment details and checking our account daily to ensure the funds was transferred.We will never ever consider British Gas as a supplier after this. This experience just demonstrated the level of misadministration and customer care by British Gas. We are strongly considering contacting the Ombudsman or trading standards to lodge our experience with them as this is clearly not acceptable standards.

1,"            Please see below which is extracted from my Ombudsman Complaint. I would advise everyone to stay away from this cover. Pay to get your boiler serviced and put the £20 away each month in case it ever breaks down.I am writing to you to see if you are able to help with a complaint I have regarding British Gas and their Homecare Service.Although I have complained to them the issues raised in my complaint will be affecting and have already affected thousands of British Gas Customers nationwide.In summary•	British Gas are advertising their products falsely on Television and online •	They are claiming to be giving your gas boiler an annual “service” when in fact they only do an emissions test and not a service as detailed in the manufacturer’s booklet.•	The majority of new condensing boilers (over the last 15 years or so) require, as part of the annual service, a condensate trap to be cleaned out and emptied. This is well known by engineers and British Gas. If this is not done on an annual service this causes sediment to build up in the heat exchanger and the condensate trap. This eventually causes the boiler to unnecessarily breakdown and damages the heat exchanger.•	British Gas are aware of this, therefore by not servicing the boilers as they should do, they are allowing boilers to break down and customers to be without heating unnecessarily.•	This also is shortening the life of the boiler which means the customers are having to replace the boilers sooner than they would need to if they have been serviced properly.•	This benefits British Gas as they are replacing boilers sooner than they need to but it is not fair on customers such as myself.•	I find this to be misleading and totally immoral and not something I would expect from a company such a British GasOn the first visit they advised me that the system needed a power flush at a cost of a few hundred pounds. It did not and does not require a flush, other engineers have checked the system since and say its fine. I think this is another example of how they are trying to make money out of customers when it is not needed.I believed on the basis of their advertisement, documents provided and the fact that I had an engineer coming out to service my boiler this is in fact what I was getting. As far as I am concerned a service is what is detailed in my boilers manual where its states “boiler service”. This is what myself and I am sure many thousands of other customers would expect. If it is an emissions test only it should state that and recommend that customers get their boiler serviced. This is wholly misleading.If for example you take your car in for a service you expect what is detailed in the service booklet to be done and not simply testing what emissions come out of the exhaust. I am sure myself and other members of the public understand this meaning of a service and their advertisements should be a lot clearer.When the engineer arrived at our property he said he was here to check and service the boiler. I asked him if he needed the manual and he said no as he could get all the details he needed off the internet. I left him to do his work and service our boiler.In February this year our boiler broke down. The condensate trap and pipe was blocked solid with a rock like material. You can clearly see it is full of grey matter and debris. This has built up over a number of years.It is clear therefore that the British Gas engineers who have been carrying out the servicing of the boiler at my home address have not been doing so. They have not been carrying out a service to the correct specification in the manual. By not doing this it can cause damage to the heat exchanger in the boiler.I am absolutely disgusted at how British Gas are operating and how they are failing to service customers boilers, allowing them to deteriorate and break down. This is in my opinion totally immoral and very misleading.It is deceitful and immoral for them not to have advised customers that they were not carrying out a service and this is what their adverts and paperwork states. They should have advised customers to arrange for a proper service and get the condensate trap cleared out which would have stopped them breaking down and needing replacing earlier than needed.I would have gladly paid £50 (which is what I have done) to get a proper service done.I find their practice deceitful, immoral and I feel thousands of customers, like me, will have assumed their boilers were being serviced when they were not. These customers were paying for breakdown cover and a service in good faith assuming that is what they were getting.I assume there will have been thousands of boilers which have broken down unnecessarily and had to be replaced earlier than needed at British Gas’s inflated costs.I really hope that something can be done to highlight and stop this and I think refunds should be given to customers who have had this type of cover and been misled like I have.

1,"            I took out British HomeCare Two cover last November, after a new hot water cylinder was fitted. I thought it was a good idea to insure my home heating system with one of the biggest companies. However, I am not very sure now.During the first two engineer visits, they serviced my boiler and adjusted all the radiators. One of them told me that the ground floor radiators were not very responsive. I was advised to take out a ""Power Flush"". I had never noticed such issue before, but since there was an issue, I asked how much to get it fixed, and I got a quote about 800 pounds. It was big money for me, so I bought two electric heaters for ground floor rooms for the winter, and plan to get Power Flush done later days. A few months later, I called a local plumber to give a quote for Power Flush. To my surprise, the plumber adjust all the radiator again, which solved the problem. He explained to me that, since my boiler was on 2nd floor, the radiators on second and first floor should be turned down to encourage more hot water flow to ground floor, which makes sense.I made complaints to British Gas customer service, given their engineer's poor service, advice and the costly winter to me as a result. The customer service lady insists that the issue I reported will be resolved INTERNALLY, and I will NOT even get a follow up call, ""because British Gas is a big company and it's customer service could not follow up with every customer"" like myself. I insisted to get a call back, and was told the call back could not be promised.I don't feel that good customer service was priority for British Gas, but it is more interested in generating extra profit wherever possible.Based on my experience, I suggested those who be advised ""Power Flush"" or any other service with additional cost from British Gas engineer. Do not trust them, and get a local plumber for a second view.________________________________________________________Just to follow up: I put down a 2 weeks deadline for British Gas to follow up with me regarding this issue during my phone call to custom service, which the customer service lady did say that it was not promised. Since then, I have heard nothing from British Gas about it, apart from the response of my review from Jamie.

I have paid a total of £ 154.11p for the insurance and still have to pay another £50 excess.  Had I had gone to a local plumber I could have had a Cylinder fitted in 24 hours fact, regardless of the Bank Holiday.  I have had nothing but constant problems with British Gas from the moment I joined and am getting fed up with the excuses!I have to boil a kettle to heat my water (for washing up twice a day and a shower for 2 adults and 2 children once a day) using more electricity than I would.

1,"            I had a fault of my fridge freezer. It took 4 engineer visits and over one month to state that it can't be repaired. Spent many hours contacting and explaining to customer care. Finally British Gas provided a gift certificate for £188 pounds to buy a new one which was about £650. I was without a fridge/freezer for one month and had to take leave from work for four 1/2 days. Unfortunately British Gas don't provide their services for kitchen appliances during weekends. Its far better to get the work done privately or buy a new product. I wanted to cancel this cover but they charge £70 to cancel. Waiting till end of my contract to cancel the whole cover (fortunately only a few months more)Hopeless service. Waste of time & Money!

1,"            We are a small business in a leased premise with no gas supply. There is an old meter in a cupboard, which has sat unused for years before we moved in when two years into our stay a BGas rep came round saying he had to read the meter monthly, even though the meter was clearly not in use this continued for 6 months before we received letters from BGas saying we had to have a contract. On a call to customer services it was agreed that as they could clearly see from the meter readings that there was no gas being used they would set up a quarterly bill which would be cancelled when I called them to remind them that we didn't actually use any gas. This ludicrous waste of everyone's time and money was, I was told necessary because there is a meter on site. I can't remove the meter as it's leased premise and the owners don't want to pay £850 to remove a meter that a future tenant may want. After many months of calling and spending half an hour on the phone to get to the same point where the quarterly bill was cancelled in full, they started billing me monthly and debt depts started to chase me regularly. I explained that while I was resigned to calling quarterly, doing it every month was just a step too far, and I'd leave the bills to the end of the quarter before calling them to get them cancelled as before. The ""debts"" escalated in their own systems to the point of thousands of pounds and when I next called they said they had had a change of policy - I now needed to pay a monthly service charge by direct debit- there was no other option other than have them remove the meter but charge me thousands for doing so and blacken my credit rating. I was assured the monthly charge would be negligible and once set up that would be an end to the matter. I agreed to a £6 a month direct debit ( to have no gas). A few months later a letter said the monthly fee was going up to £53! During my response call to them I was assured the bill would remain at £6 per month. A month later they wrote again to say it had to go up in price as we were at the end of our contract! At the next call I was told £11 per month was the best they could do - but I did have the option to get a different supplier (such as my electricity supplier) to take on the mantle of gas ""supplier"" - which I did - cancelled my BGas contract and my electricity supplier have added this in for £3 to cover the cost of the administration. British Gas have made up the rules and changed them without consulting me to suit themselves as they go. I've spent countless hours on the phone to them and had some very stressful points where they've threatened to cut off my gas supply (great I said - please do! but that they would charge me thousands for the process) As a small business I have had absolutely no choice but to accept their decisions and at no point other than last month was I told that I could take this to another more reasonable supplier.

1,"            We started having problems with our boiler back in December 2015. Four  visits from 3 different engineers later, and practically no heat through the winter, we called a local company. It transpires that we didn't need an expensive power flush, ( engineer number 1) or a new boiler which engineer number 3 suggested, but then he also told me that there was nothing wrong with our boiler (rather aggressively) and that our pipework could well be made of a material used in the 1970s which corrodes. The real problem was actually a motorised valve, replaced today, boiler fine. I have raised Complaint with scottish gas. Was told I wouldn't be able to cancel my policy, at the moment at least and was offered £30 compensation, upped to £60 when I refused it. On top of our monthly fee, we have paid £120 in excess charges. I will have to also pay our local firm.It really is disgraceful, I think I'm fairly assertive but nearly ended up paying over £800 for a totally unnecessary power flush, ( or even more on a new boiler). I wonder what happens to more vulnerable customers...

Out the blue this was offered and I jumped at the chance.11 days ago British Gas installed the 2 'dual fuel' meters - Great, really helpful, polite engineer soon had them installed and that evening I requested to switch my tariff to 'HomeEnergy FreeTime -Sat-Jul 2017' However, ever since I get a continual ""Sorry, we're having technical problems at the moment. Please come back and try again later"" when trying to log in to my account. British Gas customer service keep telling me that they also have the same problem when trying to access my account and it will be passed to their Technical Support Team.  I would expect them to have resolved this in 24-48 hours but it has now been over 11 days. I'm not asking them to dig up the road, just reset my on-line account so I can log in. If I was happy to wait 3 months I'd have stuck with quarterly estimated bills. I don't get why this is taking so long to resolve and now I don't even know what tariff I'm on. Not so Smart!

1,"            After 20 years  of being with Scottish Gas (British Gas), and having no complaints with their service, I have been so shoddily treated that I intend to switch povider.After 3 months at my new address, with no access to a gas meter which is located outside, I opted to have a smart meter installed. This would ensure hat I could adjust my usage  and budget accordingly - necessary as I have moved to the chilly Highlands of Scotland. The meter was installed in January.I was pleased to have an email inform me on 9th May that I was £224.74 in credit andtelephoned to have the funds transferred to my bank account.During this call I was informed that no meter reading had reached Scottish Gas , there were 'teething problems' with the system, so the £224 was incorrect. After being patronised , with the customer service rep telling me to'get my husband to find a key, I manage to read the meter all by myself and on submitting it,I was informed that I was now £104.96 in debit.I explained that this would not have occurred had the smart meter been operating , I would have taken measures to reduce my consumption.I today dealt  with the complaints department, who again fobbed me off with talking about their internet provider.I made the point that the smart meter had been sold to the public as a measure to ensure accurate billing, this is patently untrue. There was no acceptance of Scottish Gas taking any responsibility for ensuring that these meters are indeed working after installation.Had I not enquired, I would have continued in ignorance, running up large bills, in faith that the smart meter was fit for purpose.I have been offered , and rejected, the frankly insulting compensatory sum of £20.I have asked that my £104.96 debit be cleared, incurred as a result of no  accurate bills  being issued.This was refused and I was again offered £20 in compensation.Appalling service and 'customer care' .

After a quick diagnosis, he ordered the parts he needed and arranged to come back Friday just after lunchtime.  Well at 12:30 I got another call from him to say he was on his way and he turned up and replaced half my washing machine and it is all working brilliantly and quietly once again :-)  The engineer did give me advice on Hive (a new heating control you can set up and use on your phone) but was not pushy in the slightest.  I decided to have it installed and it is brilliant!  having had it for a few weeks now, I wouldnt be without it as tt would be like having no remote for your TV (it would still work, but the user experiance would be rubbish).  I am also really pleased to see a British owned company investing on such a great technologhy as the connected homes and will probably be buying some of the plugs you can control via the hive app too very soon.The customer service I have recieved from British gas has been second to none.

After speaking to online customer chat, who are not willing to help me with this matter, I have decided to file a proper complaint. My first payment got taken out of my direct debit account without any information that my policy will be renewed automatically. I have received no paperwork to confirm about the same.Customer advisor told me that it is under terms and conditions that policy will renew automatically. But I think it is unfair on customers to expect that they will read every single word or small print of terms and conditions. For something that important about renewal of policy should be discussed over the phone or written document.I think it a method of cheating the customer and taking money out of their bank account without telling them . I am sure british gas is making loads of illegal money like this. In this day and age, it is not ethical to have such terms and conditions and expect customer to read small prints of terms and condition.

My main issue however is that while I was on a phone call at approximately 3pm on Thursday, I was passed to a female named Abigail in the Billing department. First of all she seemed disinterested/unwilling to speak with me - I asked to be put through to a manager and explained that I was very frustrated and wanted a manager's assistance only. She put her phone - not on hold but merely down on the desk, for approximately 10 minutes, before coming back and saying 'You have to hold for a further 10 minutes' but not giving any indication that she would connect me to a manager after that period of time. I stated that she had just been speaking with the manager, that I had already been waiting a total of 45 minutes, after being passed from operator to operator, and that I wanted her to get her manager or another manager on the phone immediately - she snapped 'why are you talking like this' and I explained that I wasn't happy with the customer service I was receiving and that I was entitled to a decent service - before I was able to finish my sentence, she put the phone down on me. I would like this looked into, as from her manner, I'm not the first person she has dealt with in this way, and I would like to prevent her being in a position to do so further. I still haven't had my complaint (in relation to a refund) rectified, despite being promised numerous callbacks, and I'm genuinely shocked that a company like British Gas are allowing such poor service to be displayed by their call handlers.

I asked him if it was sorted and if I could fill my fridge back up. He said yes. Fill my fridge up, next day fridge not working. All food gone off.Call engineer out again and an told it was an error from the last engineer and a part had been ordered. Following day told that it will take 24 hours to see if part is available. Then Friday (29th April) get a call saying part needs to be ordered from Germany and won't be here till 12th may- I mean it's a Bosch fridge that is available readily! I say I have three children and its 22 degrees outside and am not happy my food has gone off. Lady says BG will pay 50 per cent towards a new fridge as a goodwill. I ask if they will fit it as its integrated - she says they don't. I ask if they will reimburse the cost for fitting, she rings her area manager who authorises it. She rings me back and confirms 50 percent towards new fridge and reimbursement for fitting. She tells me that she is going to put it through as urgent, hopefully they will get back to me that day or within 24 hours. Then nothing. Sunday - I call to chase up, department closed. Monday when I call department closed. Then I make a call daily to BG And the insurance team who work along side BG, each time passed pillar to post. Being told they need an authorisation code for reimbursement of installing fridge. I make twelve calls- no hope. No fridge 12 days! Finally an allowed to speak to a manager and have wasted about six hours if my time! Am then told it will take two weeks to order the new fridge- so you are leaving me without a fridge for nearly a month BG. Anyway agree to currys voucher in the end to speed up getting my fridge. So just to clarify authorisation was confirmed on Friday 29th April, I get vouchers in Friday 6th may- taken a whole week to get authorisation from manager who already had authorised it in Friday the 29th of April. Obviously I have had to ring about twelve times to sort this out, am frustrated and put in a complaint. Customer relations rings and says that normally you only get 30 per cent towards your new appliance and the don't pay for inastallation of integrated fridges and THAT I WONT GET ANY MORE MONEY OFF THEM. So rude,doesn't even empathise or agree with what they have done wrong. I TELL HER ITS NIT ABOUT MONEY- it about admitting you treated me badly and saying sorry! HELLO BG- you authorised it all before on the 29th ( I assume because you'd already messed me about with my food going off etc) you then make me wait a week to get the vouchers. AND BY THE WAY THE FRIDGE AT CURRYS WAS OVER £100 cheaper than what they were asking me  to pay to your insurance company (checked their website too- all items overpriced by at least £100). Then your customer relations talks to me like that. It's disgusting and I Had to wait a whole 7 days to just receive my vouchers- this is my third week without my fridge, I received an email from customer relations saying that BG had fallen below their standards but I won't be getting anything. All I wanted was an apology and acknowledgement that you messed up NOT TO BE TOLD ""you won't get anymore money off us"". Looking at all these reviews I think we should put them together and put a strong case forward. BG you really are going downhill, your staff get paid to answer customer calls. No one is going to pay for the time and distress you caused during this last week. AND ANOTHER THING I HAD TO CALL YOU TWELVE TIMES TO GET IT SORTED- BG didn't think to contact me at any point- your so quick to take our money off us- but when it comes to compensation you treat customers like this. I will be taking this further but please people find another company. IF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS HAD HELD HER HANDS UP AND APOLOGISED FOR THE SEVEN DAY DELAY I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU FIVE STARS IN YOUR REVIEW. Instead you made out I was complaining for the money. Because honesty is so important in a company and yes I'm sick of the engineers trying to sell me the new hive. Stop harassing customers for more money and start doing the jobs that the customer has already paid for.Oh also just to say have been a customer for over four years, previously have had an excellent service.

Only when I decide to leave do I find out they have not been billing my gas correctly for over a year so somehow I have ended up being in credit and debit. Now you think surly this will cancel each other out as they are both around the same amount. Oh no what British Gas do is send you a part refund on the credit and then tell you your debit is more than the credit you now have, so I now have to pay a final £90 bill double my usual monthly DD. After numerous calls and a complaint I get a resolution of having to pay a final bill of £43 to close the account and when I get the bill it's £53 as they forgot to add the addition gas into the final amount..... Here we go again back on the phone to customer service, who don't seem to understand why I am calling. Surely it's not hard to understand if you tell someone to pay a specific amount and then when they do they have to pay more= unhappy customers!

In February 2016, I noticed that we were due to have a smart meter upgrade so arranged for this to be done. When the engineers arrived (9 days after my last submitted meter reading showing a £500 credit) the engineer who swapped the gas meter input the 'correct' meter reading or so I thought, only to receive an email a few days later saying we now owned £600 meaning we had apparently used £1100 of gas and electricity in 9 days!!!! I contacted customer services only to be told they couldn't see anything wrong!!! Apparently we had used 22000kwh of gas in 9 days and that was acceptable. After many phone calls, the bill was finally corrected nearly a month later. I had to have another engineer out to connect the meter as it wasn't set up to send meter readings and we weren't supplied with a smart monitor.I'm convinced there is something dodgy about the smart meters and have a feeling our next bill will be more than last year based on very similar usage!!!! Since the smart meters have been installed, my Hive heating has been unresponsive and I've had to make many phone calls to the Hive team - who are unbelievably helpful compared to the rest of the people I've spoken to - and yet the issue is still not resolved even after having an engineer out to look at it and a signal booster sent but I feel like I'm harassing them if I call constantly.

1,"            Due to unforeseen circumstances I got behind in my payments. I emailed British gas to ask to reduce my payments but they refused. Unfortunately could not afford what they wanted me to pay. On Monday (25/4/16) I received an.email from BG saying I could set up an instalment plan. In 27/4/16 I received a letter saying they had obtained a warrant to fit a pre paid meter on 29/4/16. I called BG straight away to say I had not been informed of a court date. 2 advisors admitted we had not been notified!! This is surely wrong. We were then only given 4 days notice of a warrant entry when it should be 7. Customer service are awful. No help what's so ever and put the phone down on us. I have been trying to sort payments out for a while but they are unwilling to.help!

1,"            I have never know such bad service from a company! In fact it is non-existent. I strongly advice anybody thinking of signing up with British Gas for any of their services to think again!In February 2016 I joined a cooperative on Martin's money tips to change my gas and electricity supplier and British Gas came top with the cheapest tariff. However according to a technical error (the usual excuse they didn't have my correct details and so I had to go through the whole process again which meant I had to wait another month for the switch over.At the same time I took out their boiler home care cover online and once again I wasn't registered! I was told that there had been an error with inputting the data. I then dealt with them by phone and because of problems it took a month for a service engineer to finally come out and service my boiler ( of course they were able to take money off me with no problems at all!! My boiler broke down 5 weeks later and I arranged for an engineer to come out the following day to fix it. When an engineer didn't arrive I rang British Gas and they told me ONCE AGAIN there had been an administrative problem and I hadn't been booked in and could I wait until the following day. I told them emphatically NO! I AM NOW WAITING TO SEE IF AN ENGINEER WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TODAY! We are not talking about a one off mistake but a total lack of service since day one! Absolutely disgusting.

1,"            Having purchased a derelict house with no working gas supply and having switched supplier to EDF within 3 days, British Gas have been aggressively pursuing me for a sum in the hundreds of pounds, for gas that I quite clearly have not used. They have referred the debt to debt collection agencies without informing me and after over 6 months they continue to pursue me for it, despite the issue apparently being resolved on numerous occasions. I would implore people to avoid this company, having been a customer for only 3 days!

We rang them tonight to be told that they could only take a reading from the day after it was installed- 6 weeks ago!! They even said open the box and get a reading which I am sure is a Safety hazard. I lost my rag with the idiot on the other end as they didn't even attempt to tell us this since they received the paperwork. Back to First Utility again in two weeks thank god!

1,"            Having terminated my energy supply agreement in mid December and submitted final meter readings at that time I expected a substantial refund from British Gas as I was aware that my account was in credit.I waited patiently for my final bill and subsequent refund....... for weeks!I emailed after waiting 2 months only to be told that my credit, (that I knew I was owed), had been replaced with a debit of £7.84! I replied promptly and indicated that this situation was totally unacceptable and the balance was incorrect.At last I got my final bill on 17 Feb. 2016 showing a credit of over £1,500. I suspect many of their customers would not have been aware of any refund due and accepted the word of British Gas that their billing was correct.It had taken me 2 months and a considerable amount of my time to get a final account BUT after 2 further months I still have not been paid.My conclusions are simply to avoid using British Gas as an energy supplier as they simply cannot be trusted.Chris CaligariUPDATEWe are now in the middle of June and I am STILL awaiting my refund from British Gas.My previous post indicated my extreme displeasure with this company HOWEVER, (although I didn't think it possible), my appraisal of the company is that its treatment of its customers should deter ALL potential future customers from using them........... AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They are very swift to take action to recover money owed to them but it is a very different story when it is they that owe the money.What on earth is the office of the Ombudsman doing to allow them to keep defrauding its customers???????Chris Caligari

1,"            To try and keep this short, my husband and I sold our flat last August and bought a new property in Hertfordshire.  Before moving, we took our final meter reading and we paid our final bill last August.  We have records of all our payments to British Gas on our bank statements.Imagine my horror and upset to have received letters (in my name only) from their Debt Recovery Agency (Moorcroft), relating to an unpaid bill covering the period September to December 2015. On calling Moorcroft they said that the debt must relate to one of the other flats.  I considered the matter closed.  I then contacted British Gas and they confirmed that we owed nothing at all and said that they had called Moorcroft and explained this.  I followed up by emailing the Chairman of British Gas (cc'ed to their customer services team) and Moorcroft this week but have today received another letter from Moorcroft telling me that they were investigating etc but that if we wished to make a payment in the meantime then we could.I feel really upset and stressed by this but don't know what to do.  The guy who bought our flat from us rents it out and so the debt must have been incurred by the person who currently rents it.I don't know quite what to do about this now other than to take legal advice (which will cost us money). Any ideas?

1,"            Since buying my house in 2013 I have been with British Gas for my energy and gas. They estimated my usage and got it very wrong which left me with a debt of £500. I supplied my meter reading but they lost it. When I saw this debt on my bill I immediately rang up to sort out a payment plan - they would have let me continue racking up the bill!!! I doubled my payments to try and pay off the debt. Then, to rectify the problem they fitted my property with a smart meter which means that I pay what I use. The problem with this is that they kept reducing my monthly payments based on what the meter said I was using. BUT I need to pay more per month so I can pay off the debt! They kept  automatically reducing my payments so I am never paying off the debt but just paying what I use. It basically has tied me into staying with them as I can't afford to pay off £500 in a lump sum. Then they keep reducing my payments which stops me from paying off the debt.

They drop a massive bill with no warning. I had 2 faulty electric meters due to solar panels they passed me from pillar to post saying this department doesn't deal with this...... There prices are extortion. If you go on Uswitch I doubt they will ever get recommended. The best thing I did was leave.

2,"            I have had homecare 400  cover for a number of years and have been a very loyal customer. I have the following complaint.  I was informed by the water board there was a possibility there may be a leak at my home.Via homecare it was arranged for Dyno Plumbing to visit my home on the 11-04-2016 before 15.00.  They arrived at 16.30 nobody was home as my son had left for work. Dyno later came round that evening after I telephoned at around 10pm they were there for five minutes and informed me a 'leak detection' needed to take place and told me to contact BG for another appointment. I have recently begun a new job over 30 miles away from my home and therefore it has been difficult for me to arrange time off therefore I need hours and days that my 18 year old can be at the home.  He is at College studying for exams and works in the evenings.I then arranged an appointment for the 18-04-2016 (a Monday) for between 08.00-13.00, again nobody arrived.  When I spoke to Dyno they informed me they had left a message on my Sons mobile on the 13-04-2016 saying they would not be attending (he hadn't known there was a a message there). Again (the 3rd time) I explained to Dyno I needed a Monday due to my work commitments.  I was informed that the only dates they had were the Friday (22-04-2016) and then no other dates until May 2016. I spoke to BG and I asked if a Monday appointment could be made or a Wednesday between 12.00 and 15.00. They spoke to Dyno who then informed BG there were other dates these included the following 27th April and the 28th April however it would need to be AM or PM and they could not be time specific. My complaint is...1) I pay for this service each month, it is not a FREE and I expect a good service.  I have had to 'work around Dyno' Plumbing and they have not worked around me at all.  If they do not have enough engineers then why can't they contract this work out ?2) I have found the lack of communication absolutely appalling.  I telephoned BG on the 17-04-2016 to update the contact number for today's visit they did not inform me the job had been cancelled when I called. 3) I have now had to book an engineers visit on the same day my dog is due its operation which is obviously not ideal.4) When I asked BG if I could have this week Fridays appointment I was later informed it was PM only and not AM. Again no choice. 5) What was the reason for the cancellation on the 18-04-2016 and the late call at my home on the 11-04-2016 ?  This has not been explained to me and no apology given by Dyno either, just a rather blunt 'these are the only days we have response'. 6) In the meantime with this delay from Dyno I am genuinely concerned of the possible damage that could be occurring to my home with a suspected fresh water leak and that of the neighbours. I have found this service appalling with no customer care at all.  I will now be looking at other plumbing cover and will look for a service that can work around the customer rather than the blunt 'take it or leave' attitude I feel I have encountered with Dyno plumbing.Oh...and I tried to submit a complaint online twice and was told there was an internal processing error.  Therefore I have now emailed my complaint to them.  What a waste of an evening...

1,"            Have had excellent service from British Gas under my Homecare 200 contract until yesterday.The Engineer arrived arrived unannounced having parked his van so it blocked neighbours cars from leaving properly.He immediately tried to sell us a new boiler claiming that no spare parts had been produced for our boiler since 2003 (a lie). He said the special offer ran out on Monday. Thought such heavy selling had been banned. He tried, at least, 4 times. His manner was very brusque.Eventually he got around to discussing the problem. In spite of me telling him the boiler was in the loft, he demanded we clear out our linen cupboard. We did. After a brief look, he then said the problem was a stuck valve and he would need to access the boiler in the loft. My daughter asked him if she could take a shower. He said no as he might fall through the ceiling on top of her. He had not seen that the loft is fully boarded!I took down the loft ladder and he said he was not going up it as it was corroded. His opinion was based on a very cursory inspection and he did not point out where the corrosion is. The ladder is made of aluminium and, in my opinion, shows no signs of corrosion. Many persons have accessed the loft using this ladder including other British Gas engineers. He slammed my ladder back and has probably damaged it.  He tried unsuccessfully with his own ladder and aborted the job. I asked him to contact his Supervisor to discuss the situation and he left me his name and telephone number. I rang but just got an answer phone.  I rang British Gas and the lady told me the Supervisor probably didn't work Saturdays. She asked me to hold on. About 10 minutes later she told me that British Gas agreed that the ladder was corroded and I would have to repair the ladder before any work could commence.The Engineer had left job undone and no proper heating (with my 3 year old granddaughter staying with us).I  cancelled the contract.

1,"            I am really disappointed that their  customer service teams do not bother to listen and/or are incapable of resolving basic issues with regard to billing and treat customers with contempt.For some reason my name was on the final bill for one of my properties that has been let out long term. I provided contact details for the letting agent that lets out my properties and their team has had ample opportunity to resolve it to everyone's satisfaction, including getting paid by the appropriate parties.BG  chose not to do that an instead referred the outstanding balance to debt collectors LCS. This has infuriated me and as a result I have cancelled  my residential gas & electric contact with them  and in the process save myself circa £400 p.a. by using uswitch.LCS leave customers on hold for ages and their call back service doesn't happen either so I suspect the chances of them resolving the matter to be zero.

I have been in dispute with them since 2013 in regards to the ownership of the debt, but they seem to think that because I called their Homecare team when the boiler in the property (that did not belong to me) broke down...and was condemned. That it is reasonable to try and force me to pay nearly £3500.00 because I phoned Homecare service for an engineer to visit. The engineer called BG and arranged for someone to come and give the owner a quote. I received a threatening letter from their solicitors stating that I should pay the debt because I had phoned Homecare and That I had placed the order. When In fact I never did. Disgusting  unethical behaviour and is against the law to chase someone who does not owe the debt. Despicable to pass on to debt collection when a dispute is in place and has been for nearly 3 years. Appalling service that does not want to solve the problem, but rather harass someone for money that they do not owe.

In total it took the engineer over 55 minutes to clear a pipe which he knew was the issue instantly (should have taken 5 minutes to unscrew and clean pipe), however the time spent on my property was taken up by spending time on the phone/meet with other colleagues at the van at a cost of £199 to me!

As it turns out, the free Homecare started the day my boiler was installed, which didn't make sense to me at all. As a protest, I decided not to continue the Homecare package with BG, as I thought I thought that I could rely on the 5 year warranty from Worcester. Today, my 17 month old Worcester 24Ri boiler broke down and the Worcester customer service rep told me that I am not covered by the usual 5 year warranty as the boiler was installed by BG, and they had agreed to reduce the 5 year warranty to only 1 year. This was not pointed out to me at the time of the contract with BG. I will seek legal advice tomorrow as I think I should have a case either against Worcester or BG for agreeing to reduce the warranty to only 1 year.

Water gets hot then goes cold then hot again , a proper pain when I,m in the shower.             The first  "" ENGINEER ""  found no problem. ( £50 excess paid for the privilege ) . Two month later, second.                     "" ENGINEER "" found no problem ( £50 excess paid for the privelige )  Another month later a third "" ENGINEER "" put it down to my faulty shower cartridge as he had the same problem at home. (£50 excess paid for the duff information ) . Then he steered me to buying a new boiler,                     ( presumably on commission ) . Over the last two years the boiler has had a small leak so I keep a dish underneath and empty it every week, neither of the three BRITISH GAS ENGINEERS mentioned anything saying all is good.So having said all this I have finally cancelled my contract and binned british gas .There was a time when BRITISH GAS meant quality, not any longer ! In my opinion these guys are amateurs and no better than your average back street garage mechanics but with smarter overalls.

The old owners had a prepay meter; I asked British Gas the day I moved in to change it to a normal account. Advisor said this would be done within 48 hours. A couple of days later my electricity went off as I obviously hadn't been topping up! The stupid advisor failed to tell me that someone had to come and physically take it out. This took a couple of weeks to do.When I finally changed over to a standard account, I cancelled straight away to move to another provider. They took my final meter reading incorrectly, so my final bill was much higher than it was supposed to be. After countless calls to them and my new provider, I finally got them to update the meter reading and re-issue the bill. I had told them that in the meantime I obviously would not be paying the bill until they re-issued it correctly; the advisor had said its fine and not to worry. In this time I had several calls from their team asking why I hadn't paid my bill! Finally, it got re-issued on 26th Feb 2016 which was due on 11th March; I paid the bill within a couple of days. It is now 9th March and I am getting calls from BPO, a debt collection agency to see why I haven't paid my bill from 26th Feb!! This company is an absolute joke, please stay well away and go with one of the smaller providers.

Michael, the engineer who carried out the work, kept us well informed during the process. All the other tradesmen, scaffolders, electrician and builder, arrived on time and carried out their respective work in the same courteous and efficient manner. We had a small problem regarding the upstairs bathroom cistern not flushing properly. This was because the plumbing was changed to mains water from storage tanks. I called British Gas and spoke to Fiona, on customer services who then put me through to Rita who was able to arrange for someone to call in on the Monday. Another Michael arrived and sorted the problem very quickly. Rita called me back later in the week to ensure that everything was fixed. We very much appreciated this and wanted to say a huge thank you to all the British Gas people who have given us a really great heating system. We know that we have the support of a large company should anything go wrong and that it will be fixed quickly.  All of the people I have mentioned are a credit to British/ Scottish Gas.

Finally I spoke to an agent that did help, and who was polite and professional during our call and who apologised for the other agent.

1,"            I had a Landlord's gas safety certificate inspection carried out as part of a yearly homecare service inspection at my rented out flat on 28th January 2016. No certificate arrived by email or post, or shows on my online account. I have had many conversations with British Gas on the phone and opened a formal complaint which is being dealt with by email exchange but I do feel that the answers provided from the Landlord team to the customer complaints representative and subsequently to me are a fob off, and there has been very little contact from the landlords team other than automated email responses. It's now March, and after 5 weeks of waiting for the certificate I am increasingly concerned that there is an underlying problem with creating the certificate full stop and that nothing is actually being done, although I am being told otherwise. This is an extremely important issue as I, as a Landlord, am legally obliged to provide my tenants with a CP12. I feel that I have been very badly let down by British Gas and will in future be having independent gas safety checks carried out - as the minimal additional expenditure incurred is more than worth the stress caused by my experiences with British Gas.Update - as I feared I've now been told that the 'notes' of the visit are lost and that the inspection will need to be carried out again. Meanwhile I've been 5 weeks without a CP12 and potentially putting my tenants lives at risk and liable for prosecution! Completely unacceptable.

1,"            I had a boiler problem so i decided to sign up for the boiler care service from british gas. I called on saturday morning and was told that there wouldn't be an engineer until sunday. This obviously annoyed me given their claim of coming out to 9/10 call outs in the first day, but i ignored it and signed up anyway. I called again in the early afternoon just to check if an appointment had come up but it had not but i was assured that I would get an engineer out on sunday morning. Sunday came and went, in the afternoon i called them just to find out that they had cancelled the appointment without contacting me. So i rearranged the appointment for monday afternoon, taking time off work to do so. again i waited until 6pm and called again, this time I was assured that the engineer was just delayed. so I waited for another hour and called again. apparently the engineer had clocked off and just left my job open. at this point i had had enough and cancelled the annual service. If you every want to see an engineer or have your boiler repaired at any point don't bother.

1,"            they write to the tenant when the cp12 is due and if any problems are found. they also encourage the tenant to report any problems directly to them rather than via the landlord meaning the landlord incurs their excess.

Called a local gas engineer who did a service for £35 just to make sure. The reference number is my appointment reference.

1,"            It all began with a Quotation for a new boiler by Keith Barnes.  It took an hour to discuss the product and agree to sign up.  We were advised several times that finance was available and that Keith was unable to advise us in anyway regarding this.... He did an exceptionally good job of steering us in the right direction without offering advice.... We signed up, he showered us with information on how we were getting a higher priority than others because we had children, he arranged the installation to take place within 4 days.... Brilliant news, the best engineer in the northwest is available for you, he's been installing boilers for over 30 years, been with the business since he was 19..... Awesome!  Make sure you leave the old boiler by the shed I can get some pennies for that at the scrapers....The engineer will come round and install on the Monday then finish off on the Tuesday, they will even match the bricks by taking a photo of them and heading down to the local builders merchant in order to get the match as close as possible... this is the perfect install....... Monday, looks like the electrician could have been with BG for 30 years but the installer (Mark) no chance.... was this falsehood number one?  Finished Tuesday afternoon, seems OK.... Oh hang on, something definitely isn't right here..... So the flue is in but the bricks used to fill in the wall around it, they don't look right.... Infact they are not the same colour, nor the same size..... how on earth are these a match for the existing bricks?? easy answer, they aren't they are the spare bricks that I had sitting down the side of the shed pending another project.... So the installer didn't match the bricks?  He didn't go to the local merchant to buy some?  He found whatever he could lying around my property to fill in the hole and even then he left a good 3inch gap that was just filled with mortar.... nice.... An d you do this without my permission... I call that THEFT!  II complain to Steve Jones (district manager) No apology, infact he defended his installer (Mark) he offers to refund approx. £200 for the building work and a further £50 for inconvenience.... How this compensates me I don't know as I still have to rip down their shabby work and rebuild to an acceptable standard.... Mark the installer calls, ""is everything ok?"" Funny!!!! ""No It Isn't""..... Next thing.... Very very loud rattle coming from the brand new boiler!  This is within 48 hours of the installer leaving.  Enough is enough, remove this piece of rubbish, put the old one back in and let call it a day..... Hang on, you have disposed of the old boiler.... I gave strict instructions not to!  Brilliant, this just gets better.  Let's speak to Dave Dakin the Area director because the girl at the call centre doesn't really care about my opinion nor my request so she has just cut me off.... I get the general idea that Mr Dakin doesn't really care either, I get the feeling we are not trying to dwell on what poor service we have had so far but let's focus on what we can do to try and sort the issue..... engineer comes round 5 days after the install to advise he cant fix it as there is something stuck in the pipe..... 7 days after the install, another engineer along with Steve Jones arrive at the house  to remove the item lodged in the pipe.... 7 days after that (With no further contact from BG) Mr Dakin calls again to see how everything is going.... No apology received, no compensation received, no follow up email from the complaints team...... they do not care, they are not willing to admit fault, they say they are focussed on the customer and their satisfaction but this cant be the case as the regional directors don't even give a monkeys...... Never ever again will a member of BG enter my property and I will tell anyone and everyone on how bad their service is....

2,"            For the last few years our boiler works fine before the annual service.Then after the service we have again had issues with the boiler ever since, same as last year. The best bit is our premiums have shot up because of the number of call outs, prompted by the poor initial service.

1,"            I have held BG Homecare for 11 years and had no major problems until now. Previously, I would say the service provided was between average to good. Recently I had an intermittent fault with the flow switch in my boiler. Engineer arrived, cleared out diaphragm - flow switch fixed, job done. However, later in the afternoon we noticed a leak from the boiler and the radiator used to de-pressurize the system. Called BG and a 2nd engineer came out the next day and informed us of 3 leaks coming from the boiler left by the previous engineer. The leaks were fixed and all radiators bled. Boiler, heat and hot water all sorted - no problems. Just when the engineer was about to leave he noticed a very minor leak from the manifold and said he would order a replacement and get it fitted tomorrow. The next day the 1st engineer arrived again with the part in hand. After dismantling the boiler he checked on the internet how to replace the manifold and then realised he had the wrong part. After a lot of huffing and puffing, and complaining he should not be here as was very busy, he said he could not fix, and would put back together the best he could. He informed my wife that the boiler would have to be kept on 24hrs a day, 7 days a week to maintain performance. He changed an inlet water pipe for no apparent reason and also fixed the motorised valves to the max position. If we switched off, the flow switch no longer worked. When I arrived home I was not impressed with the engineers solution and when read his notes noticed he had wrote the part was obsolete. After a quick check on the internet, I found the part is still in circulation from a number of retailers. I was working away from home so left as the engineer had said until I could be home for the next visit. It has been a week so far, and am waiting for the next engineer to come out. I feel as though some of the engineers are simply incompetent and worse still, are trying to create faults to force people into buying a new boiler.

3,"            I needed a new boiler and chose British gas knowing I’d pay over the odds but hoping this would result in a problem free job. How wrong I was. The basic installation is fine but the electrical work was a disgrace and I also didn’t get the system I’d specified. Although this was a fairly minor issue, I had to try three times to get any response and only then by resorting to a formal complaint. This led to a visit from a stroppy manager who seemed to think his job was to sort me out rather than the problem. I resented the need to get heavy with him but did so and the issue was finally resolved satisfactorily but I am conscious of the fact that an average 'little old lady' in the same position would have been walked all over. I now have a good system with which I am happy. My initial reason for choosing BG was that I felt they would provide a good response to any problems. I was wrong and therefore can’t recommend them.

When he did eventually arrive following week and dismantled boiler he immediately noticed problems with casing and had to condem boiler, which is fair enough if it was dangerous.

1,"            I have had a nightmare with Dyno. I am insured under a homecare agreement and I called them for a leaking tap. The first plumber came and told me to get a new cartridge for the tap which I did next day from the tap's maker. Then another plumber came and was not able to change the cartridge, told me it was the wrong one, shut down the tap completely and told me to get a new tap. One week later my handyman was able to replace the cartridge which was perfectly fine to use. The worst came when I filed a complain and was basically told that they had done nothing wrong as they had advised to change tap. I proved to them that they had advised to change cartridge, that the maker had advised on the spare which was fine and they had also broken a tile along the way. After 3 or 4 mail exchange they would still come short of an apology and remained convinced that there was something wrong with the cartridge which is now working perfectly. They offered to come around and mess about with the tap to understand why the plumber had not been able to fix the tap. There was absolute denial that maybe incompetence was the cause of the problem. The whole experience was frustrating and time consuming. They were only interested to defend themselves rather than understand the cause of the complain

1,"            Baxi WM 40/4 wall mounted gas boiler.BG called out 25.12.15 for boiler failure...fan sticking so lubricated it and part ordered fitted a few days later. No gas leaks reported.BG called 27.1.16 Dean Rolly engineer called. Boiler not working but noted gas valve faulty so engineer decided to replace gas valve. Parts ordered fitted 28.1.16 gas leak noted so blanked off boiler gas now leaking following the repair. Boiler condemned and told occupiers to get new boiler.I spoke to an independent engineer, who said its most unusual as pipe (not listed in available spares) will have been there 20 years, so the engineer must have done something during the exchange that caused the leak. Its a straight forward replacement of a part. If there was no gas leak before the exchange but there was one after then the engineer must have caused the leak?I arranged for BG to come out and explain what they had done? Engineer called out (Rhys Painter) 5.2.16 and said he wasn't the original engineer but has just spoken to the original engineer (Dean Rolly), so how could he help? He went back to his van with his phone and came back on the phone to the original engineer. I explained to Dean that I wanted to know how common it was to do this repair and then have to condemn the boiler. He said very common. I asked who had made the decision to change the faulty Gas Valve, he said he had. It seems quite a big decision to make given that the work resulted in condemning the boiler and resulted in us having to pay £3,000 for a replacement.I stated that I wasn't happy and would like to escalate this complaint higher to which he said he would notify his manager David Orton. I stated my immediate availability as the house was without hot water and proper heating. As yet no response. I appreciate its the weekend but how often do BG just cause leaks cap off and drum up business for sales as they can't fix a gas leak that they caused during a straight forward part replacement?

He totally went out of his way to ensure we received a very high level of service, over seeing all the work in our house from the beginning of the job right to the end.  I would highly recommend British Gas to anyone looking to purchase a new boiler.

1,"            ******AVOID************AVOID************AVOID******I feel I should let you know what happened when you have a new system installed by British Gas. I'll keep this short and factual.I had a BG rep out last year, I told him I'd received better quotes than his. He assured me that ""the work would be completed quicker and better than anyone else, and that if there were ever to be a problem the aftercare service is outstanding, it will be worth the extra money"".Well, how wrong was I to trust him!The complete system comprised of a new Worcester boiler (the biggest most expensive domestic boiler they make) and a new set of radiators, valves etc. It cost me over £10,000.The work was completed 6 months ago.The boiler has broken down on 5 separate occasions since installation. I have taken 6 days off work to allow access. We had to move out of the house and stay in a hotel as we had no hot water or heating. They have stripped down the boiler and put it back together changing various components several times. On the penultimate visit they realized the boiler had been fitted incorrectly in the first place. Their attempt to rectify this involved adding more unsightly pipes to my property, and left damage to my worktop.The last engineer confirmed that the boiler was now ""plumbed correctly"" but had some doubts concerning some of the new radiators they'd fitted. He said he'd need to take the floor boards up to check. He hasn't been back.All in all, I'd say I have been ripped off. I have been offered no compensation whatsoever. I do genuinely hope this gets through to others who are considering them. Naturally I'll be taking legal action very shortly but want to make everyone aware, the biggest are not always the best.

1,"            I must say a very disappointing experience with Home care. After the most recent spate of engineer visits we are now left with a faulty boiler with a persistent leak. BG seams to be washing there hands of us, something I thought could not happen with the protection plan.We inherited this 12 year old boiler, supplied by BG, from the previous owners ten years ago and have had nothing but trouble with it ever since. Some of the problems have been persistent, with others only ever temporally fixed. We must have had something like 4-5 visits every year most of which are in winter. At one point BG tried to get out of the agreement blaming sludge and scale but we had had the system flushed.It seems to me that some of the engineers are not competent and throw parts at it and hope it works. According to a Baxi engineer some of these parts were for a different boiler. When the BG engineer fails to fix it they  blame the boiler and recommend we buy a new one from them at an inflated cost which can easily be beaten by a local plumber. We never thought that after paying all these years of Home Care protection, that we would be left in this position in the middle of winter with two young children.  I look forward to BG's response.

1,"            Engineer visited on Jan 18th to undertake a scheduled routine annual service during which he damaged a component rendering my boiler unrepairable as the part is no longer available. British Gas have since offered a £700 reduction in the cost of a replacement boiler as a ""goodwill"" gesture. Salesman called on 25th Jan to survey and quote. Turns out that the ""half price"" boiler offer doesn't apply in addition so the £700 reduction effectively becomes £275. Also the ""starting price"" for the quote for the boiler exchange was £368 higher than a Dec 2014 quote for the same ""job"". The latest quote did not include a £100 (Homecare loyalty) bonus reduction (allowed in 2014) ..effectively and for ""breaking"" my boiler British Gas were prepared to charge me £300 less than last year's quote, which should have been discounted (in my opinion) by £424 (half price boiler offer + £100 loyalty). My advice is whatever you do DON'T have BG supply and fit a new boiler . It's a rip off!

An engineer was sent out on Wednesday the 13th Jan, however the engineer could not fix it and said it would need to be referred to Bosch, for one of their engineers to attend. We were also advised that Bosch would be in touch within 24hrs.We heard nothing within the 24hrs (on Thur) and called BG on Friday 22nd of January. We were advised that the reason we had heard nothing was due to the BG manufacturing team being busy? But we would now hear from Bosch within 48hr? (this included the hours over the weekend)96hrs (4 days) later we have still heard nothing from Bosch nor BG. Today Tuesday, 8 days after making BG aware of the problem, we have had to call BG again to find out what is happening. I was advised they will look into it. I made a complaint.British Gas appear to be happy taking your money each month, for what is supposed to be a premium service, but based on the above, I will not be renewing my contract and advise others who are considering taking out their cover with BG, to look at other service providers first.RegardsPM

1,"            Having avoided Britsh Gas for almost a decade due to horrendous problems with a previous account I stupidly decided to give them another try, mistakingly thinking that they had probably improved in ten years. BIG, BIG MISTAKE! Firstly I called to enquire about transferring my dual fuel to them, after waiting 20 mins for an available assistant I explained the reason for my call.  She took my details and said she needed to transfer me as I was currently on a pre pay smart meter for both gas and electric. I gave up holding after listeningt to their annoying music down the receiver for another 20 mins. Amazingly, almost as soon as I hung (and they realised they might lose a potential new customer), an advisor miraculously became free and called me back. I explained that I was on prepayment smart meters with Utilita, meaning that there is no slot in the meters for the key or card as top up in a shop or over the Internet is automatically uploaded to the meters. I further explained that I now wished to transfer from this type of meter to a standard meter for gas and electric and would like to pay by monthly direct debit.  I was told this would be fine and we agreed for the transfer to take place on 18th Dec 15. I was told I could set up a direct debit after this date. Everything seemed fine until I suddenly received a top up gas card through the post. The instructions stated that I needed to insert this into my my meter before topping up. Somewhat of an impossibility as there is nowhere in the meter to insert it. I tried calling but again all operators were busy and I gave up after queuing for an unreasonable amount of time. As my gas and electric supply was clearly still running, I assumed this was an error and didn't worry too much. After Christmas I decided to go online to set up my monthly direct debit as calling them alwYs leads to waiting in some never ending queue. However, after submitting all my details I received an automated response saying I could not set up direct debit as I was on a pre payment meter! Clearly I am not because I have never received a key for the electric and there is no where to insert the gas card they sent and they have been supplying me with fuel since 18th December without me paying a penny! So, I submitted yet another online form detailing all the above and asking them to sort it out without delay as I don't want to run up a huge bill before setting up a direct debit. I received an auto reply saying I might have wait up to 3 working days for a response! I wasn't happy but what could I do as I work long hours in a call centre myself and calling is not easy when they cannot answer your call without making you hold for eternity?  My reply actually came 4 working days later! The reply only ever referred to my gas account and did not even mention my electric account. It asked me to complete a form by selecting which type of meter I was currently on, pre payment or standard! Then they asked for meter readings which I had already sent two prior to all this! There were more questions, which had the advisor of actually read and digested the email he was replying to, he'd have realised I'd already supplied the answers in that very email! Yet another acknowledgement saying wAit up to 3 working days. That was on 7th January! I still haven't received a reply! What a shockingly bad way to treat a new customer. The lack of understanding by all the advisors I have dealt with is beyond compare.  No-one seems to have a brain cell between them. I work in customer services myself and if I bungled my way through enquiries in that manner I'd have collected my P45 a long time ago! Needless to say I've had enough now and will be making calls to potential new suppliers tomorrow when I finish work, I will arrange a new supplier by the end of the day. So well done British Gas, you managed to mess up so much after supplying my energy for less than one month that you have now lost me as a customer. Oh and one last thing, I will make sure that this review is continuously pasted across multitudes of social networks so that other people who might consider giving you their custom can be given the option of avoiding you like the plague!

Sadly the gas engineer declared the boiler dead and unrepairable due to cost and lack of availability of parts :(On the 4th January when the manufacturer opened for business I called to verify this information...........guess what the parts required were available!I reminded British Gas of the terms of their Home Care agreement and an engineer was dispatched the next day to give a second opinion. He agreed with me that the parts were available and a repair appointment was arranged. Repair now completed and I haven't got to spend £4k plus on a new boiler :)

1,"            I have been overcharged in gas since 30th of April 2014, if you see my account (8510009429430) before 30th of April 2014 was charged correctly but after have been overcharged. I had made several calls to British Gas after given my meter reads and the bills coming so high for someone that uses gas so moderately as live alone and never at home but they never investigated what was happening, it is so easy to have a look on my bills history and see that is definitely something wrong from 30th of April 2014,  bills are always coming around £250 pounds, £350 pounds or more per month after given my meter read, before it was coming around £100 - £120 monthly, I am overcharged on my gas part not electricity. I even had closed the account on 30th of October (851000942943) and opened a new one (851004940561) to see if that could solve the problem and to do a test then had waited one month to give my meter read, then gave the meter read on second of December and my bill came at 313.61 pounds, which is impossible for a month as I barely used the gas and my boiler wasn't even working. then called again to explain what happened again and they finally had booked someone to come over and have a look at my meter reader, had left work earlier to be at home waiting and the person never showed up, then on 16th of December I had booked a British Gas engineer to come over to have a look at my boiler then he went to have a look at my meter reader and the engineer Chris Maslen had explained they had changed my meter reader on 30th of April 2014 but they had  forgot to update in the system and for that reason I was being overcharged in gas since 30th of April 2014, we both called British Gas and had explained what happened and the advisor Romeo Salomon had apologised me and said I would be refunded and my meter reader updated in 5 working days, I have been waiting since,  Had already called British Gas twice and they said the advisor is still looking to it and they seem to know nothing about it. I only had received an apology letter giving me 20 pounds refund for the missing appointment. I have had a really bad experience with Britsh Gas in the last months and the service wasn't appropriate, I have been sitting duck making several calls and explaining and nobody had investigated, I would like to pay what I spend!!!! I want peace in 2016 please!

2,"            For customer service this has to be the worst. I applied to switch to BG on 1 December. I set up my online account and provided bank details etc, all of which were acknowledged by email. On 21 December I was asked to provide meter readings which would be used as a starting point with BG and end point with my old provider. These were accepted by email by BG. A few days later I decided to change my bank for direct debit purposes. Did this successfully online again with acknowledgement from BG. Then I got an email from BG saying my meter readings had been rejected but no reason why. After a number of calls and emails to the CEO the readings were accepted. Then I got an email saying they had changed my bank details!! This was WITHOUT my permission. Again I had to go through the CEO to ask why and to get confirmation that nothing would be changed. The first direct debit should have been taken on 5 January - guess what - they didn't take anything. Three emails later and I've still heard nothing. BG do NOT respond to online queries, the people I've spoken with on the phone assure me it will be sorted but nothing is. I'm constantly having to keep on top of things online.Their Customer Service is non-existent. I deeply regret switching and can't wait for my one year fix to be up so that I can dump them!!

1,"            British Gas engineer was great, identified issue with mixer valve connecting to thermal store, which he could fix next day for £220 but as it was covered under plumbing cover, he said it would be cheaper for plumber to do, so he arranged for plumber to come.  Plumber came three days later, he was told the issue but wanted to find the issue himself. Examined thermostat, which broke when examined.  Ordered new thermostat, started emptying tank ready for thermostat and realised as we had hot water the original issue identified by British Gas engineer was correct but he did not have the parts and they would take a while to get.  Was told that tank was too corroded to fix, so no thermostat was fitted and so needed new tank.  Then told didn't need new tank as thermostat was a backup, so could bypass mixer valve and get hot water.  He started system without the thermostat but now no heating or water, so said we now needed British Gas engineer and went after arranging for British Gas next day.  Heating started half an hour after he left so then cancelled engineer visit.  Water still did not get hot so made new appointment for plumbing engineerer on next day, waited in all day - 10 hours, no engineer, no call.  Chased next day, got new appointment for 4 days time.  So, will have had no hot water for 9 days and system is in a worse state than when I called them out.

Rang for service 28 December and told too busy to come that day unless being cold would put my health or life in danger. The man on the switchboard was difficult to understand (no, I am not hard of hearing) with a pronounced NE accent  and speaking quickly /mumbling. I am 68, a widow on my own, but fortunately fit and well and still working as a part time specialist nurse. Would I treat my patients in that manner? Certainly not and would make every effort to meet their needs promptly. A pity BG don't see it the same way. This is an expensive service, advertised as same day service 365 days of the year. Then when the engineer did come the following day he didn't have the part (electrical circuit board) and had to go elsewhere for it and come back an hour later. The engineer 's service was excellent, clean and tidy worker and a very nice young man. I now have to face the electricity bill for the intervening period for an expensive electric fire and immersion heater for which BG will hardly give a discount!

Severn Trent had identified the underground leak with thousands of litres of water a day going underneath the house. Just some highlights from the British Gas service: Engineer turning up to detect an underground leak with no equipment (no he didn’t have x-ray vision), ‘we’ll call you back’ - no they won’t (not sure BG are capable of making outgoing calls maybe they haven’t paid their bill), ‘you can’t speak to the insurance department, we don’t even have a number’ - the number magically appears when you ask to speak to their manager, ‘insurance is being sorted as we speak’ - no it wasn’t, ‘we can do the excavation work on a weekend’ - no they can’t, Dynorod personnel openly critical of British Gas (maybe no one has told them they are part of British Gas).  In the end (3 weeks) we gave up and had a third party solve the problem in about 8 hours (from call-out to fix).Strangely, they have a lot of positive reviews appear in the last few hours (quiet time in the office I guess). Would suggest you look a little further down to the many one star reviews from the past few months!

1,"            TBH the homecare service is very mixed with 'proper' gas repairs being good but the plumbing and drains being less so in our experience. Had dyno rod out through BG who replaced the ball valve in the cold water tank after it just constantly overflowing, failed again now after about two year possibly (I'd have expected a longer time in all honesty). Not a major problem as I just periodically drain the expansion tank (a pain but but manageable). Off work over Christmas so decide to phone today Tuesday 29/12 and told next available plumber is Thursday 31/12 08.00-18.00 which doesn't work for NYE arrangements, so ask for the next one and told Friday 01/01/16 which also doesn't work next one then is Monday 4/1/16 as can book a Saturday but it will be cancelled responding to emergencies. I query the delay and am told its due to the flooding! which in complete BS due to my location. Ask to speak to a supervisor and told 'no point' as they wont be able to do anything else (not really very customer centric!). Eventually get the number for Customer Services who agrees its BS about the flooding and says he'll speak to dyno-rod (who do the plumbing and drains for BG) and I'll get a call in five minutes. No call back ever happens. So I go back online and book the appointment on line and then phone dyno rod who make the appointment for 08.00 - 13.00 on 31/12, which was all I was after. All in all a bad customer experience. The gas cover is fine, I checked and I could get a gas engineer out same day with BG for a central heating problem and that bit has always been same or next day call out. All in all I'd say OK for gas cover but not plumbing and drains. I'm now going to check out the price for homeserve to see how they shape up.

1,"            Reviews only matter if the company you are reviewing care about their customers...and British Gas, Dyno-rod clearly do not; as you can see from my and many other bad reviews that have not been responded to.I won't repeat the incident I had with Dyno-rod (Now owned by British gas) but they just sent me an email saying that because they did not record my telephone call with the person I booked the job with they do not believe what I am saying, It is my word against the receptionists...does anyone remember the days of the customer is always right... I know that is not true but when it IS True, it is unbelievable that they refuse to consider my legitimate claim on this basis, it is such poor customer service they could at least have made it a bit more professional and said it did not meet their claims criteria or something but to openly say we believe our receptionist over you is shocking as though that person never makes mistakes like she did on this occasion.Because of the way I have been treated It is clear they always say no and trust that 99% of people give up but I know I am in the right and although it seems like a task I cannot win I feel it is more like a David and Goliath scenario and I will keep going on principle so these giants stop treating us like trash...onwards and upwards :).................4.6.15 Review addition based on the response from British Gas below:Further proof they do not care about us, the faux commiserations from Jamie Lee from British gas where he agrees I should have been given the benefit of the doubt was just a ruse to get my rant off public display. It turns out the social media team have no influence at all only to act as damage limiting PR agents. I will continue fighting to get back to a decent level of customer service from these faceless giants

1,"            Totally incompetent, waste of money service. I have at least five engineers around and lost a lot of time off work to get my boiler working. The engineers are shockingly incompetent, arrogant and has left us in a lot of discomfort. The telephone service has no connection to the engineers and have called out the wrong engineer despite us requesting to send the previous one, who specifically asked us to get him to come out as he was in possesion of a vital part. The engineer in here now that is trying to fix has come up with an entirely different diagnosis, broken a part in the process of the repair and has told us that we will be out of hot water and heat tonight. He has offered a fan heater. He will come back to fix everything tomorrow. One of the engineers was apparently in marketing and advertising and got bored with his job and decided to become a gas engineer. God help us. My complaint two weeks ago has been completely ignored and when I asked to speak to the manager to Andrew Huntely today, he told his colleague to tell me that he was too busy. After I insisting to speak to him, the telephone guy told me the manager will ring me back. We are truly shocked at the incompetence and arrogance of the staff. The service is a joke. I have seen better service and professionalism in third world countries. They are taking £26.68 from our account to provide such a shambolic service. I can see from the reviews on this site that we are not alone. I will be taking this up with the Ombudsman and Ofgem. MPower got fined £20m for mistreating customers. I think British gas is next. I will also be getting in touch with BBC Watch Dog.  It's 22nd December and just three days to go for Christmas. We are now very nervous that these people may create a miserable Christmas for us by not fixing things properly. We have lost confidence. I would advise others to stay away from BG boiler service as it seems to be rocket science for them.

1,"            In all the years we have had this never had to utilise it until this weekend when suffered a water leak from upstairs bathroom straight down through the lounge light (approx 1.30pm). Switched off water & contacted BG who duly took details, said they would pass to disptach & someone would be out before 6pm. Call received back from plumbers who advised no one on Isle of Wight so would pass to drainage company (AKA Dynorod) who advised would be out to try & locate leak today (Saturday). Had to phone back BG to ensure electrician had also been informed.Was advised to switch off electric at mains. Fortunately ours is a system that can isolate just the downstairs lights but call handler was insisting switch it all off (dont think so).Sat around waiting & nothing. Called back just after half 6 to enquire whereabouts and after going back through data protection cr** yet again advised would check with dispatches. Received call from dynorod -response was they are on an emergency call that is taking longer than thought...but they will be with you tonight! Electrician calls - no one available on the Isle of Wight so would have to pass over to Sunday shift. Then nothing. Approx 10pm I call again, trundle all through data protection yet again. Information given this time is that there is NO ONE from drainage on the Isle of WIght so would be passed over in the morning. At this point I am having a severe sense of humour failure so to appease all of a sudden they find a BG Central Heating engineer with limited knowledge of Plumbing. He arrives just before 11pm & had only been sent to make the house safe by switching off water & Electric!!!!!!Why? because they can. My water & electric had been off since 1.30pm.This morning I receive a call from electrician who was going to try & sort someone out today but as i was going out to my daughters Christmas dance show I was not going to be back until after 1pm. He duly called back but once realised leak had not yet been dealt with put me straight through to Dynorod. They had no reference from yesterday to say the job had even been requested so took my details & as by now we had been without water for 24 hours put it through as an emergency job. At last you may think but noooooooo. Call back a bit later from Dynorod very apologetic but they have no engineers on the Isle of Wight so it will have to wait until tomorrow. I have been in dialogue with BG facebook page & at one stage was advised that jobs are prioritised with the most vulnerable being dealt with first. How the hell can you prioritise a service that does NOT EXIST on the Isle of Wight out of hours & weekends. And for the privilege of all this we pay £33.99 a month

2,"            Called tonight as my wife said British Gas hadn't been in contact yet for our annual service on our heating and boiler, and also our two yearly electrical inspection.  Turns out we are overdue heating and boiler check, had too ask about the electric inspection again, informed that they no longer do them.  I don't remember receiving a letter telling me this, checked small print on renewal received last week and it says no longer doing them.  Very poor service, firstly when where they going to contact us about the heating/boiler service and disgusted at the non electrical cover inspection.  Checked online to see what the current service plans included, then discovered that a new customer would pay £25 per month, we have been a loyal customer for 8 or 9 years and getting ripped off by paying £33 and getting less than what I first signed up for.  I could tell you's about the sales agent who tried to sell me an overpriced upgrade, but that's an other story.  I will be switching after Xmas.

Having signed up online, i Booked the initial engineer visit and was amazed to learn after 10 minutes that my boiler would not be covered as it was not on the list of boiler models. Wow! I was looking to spend over £200 / year and had waited in all day for my first visit to learn that my fully working and 1 year old boiler would not be covered. I rang BG and they simply cancelled my policy.I will be using a local plumber to service my boiler and will not waste spending a premium on such a nonsensical attitude to customers. The reviews on this site are pretty bad. The engineer who visited was very nice and he seemed embarrassed by the whole episode. But it's quite common apparently.Ho humm!

1,"            Engineer attended my property to look at my Miele gas hob which was not working properly on 6th October. He didn’t even bother looking at the hob as it was Miele and i was told we can’t repair as we don’t have parts and they would have to get Miele to look at it. So i phone the appliance care team a few days later saying it would need to be written off but the engineer will have to contact the replacement team to authorise this. Few days later i ring back, i was told that there was no update from engineer and they would need to send another engineer to confirm that the appliance is not repairable. Second engineer attends property on 14/11/15. Same response i.e. cant repair and will get in touch with either Miele or replacement team.Few day later i ring up and was told that they were still awaiting engineers report. I ring back every day nearly and get same response. Then they say we can’t contact that engineer so we will have to send a third engineer to have a look. Third engineer arrives on Sunday 6th December, refuses to enter property as he said he’s been to my property previously and he know that its a Miele hob so cant repair it. He said he will convey this to the appliance care team. To date I have not received any feedback since Sunday. This is appalling service I have wasted days waiting for these engineers and endless number of phone calls.  If they can’t repair Miele hobs then why take my payment for this cover. Why can’t they chase these engineers for feedback. The way i have been treated is disgraceful. I have buy to let properties on which we have taken on the same cover. I am seriously thinking of cancelling these and would not recommend BG to anybody!

1,"            So our installation started 19/11/15. I had the quote from William Brooks, after his quotation I had around 5/6 phone calls daily asking me if I would like to accept the quote. Eventually after lots of conversations and comparing quotes with other companies we went with BG, so we paid the 50% deposit. A month went by and we didn't hear anything from British Gas( now that they have our money). Eventually an engineer called me saying he was doing the install today but he is delayed so will start Thrusday (19/11/15). He turned up, ripped out our old boiler and left us until Monday with no hot water or heating which we were not very please about considering it was 2 degrees in the house. No worries your heating will be on by Tuesday he told us, another week went by and finally we had hot water and heating.... But due to not having time/apparently not being included in the job quote, the pipe work to the boiler from the gas meter would not be upgraded to allow sufficient gas supply to the boiler and other appliances.... The reason we went with BG is because they said this would be done as it is a must. I had already got EDF to change the Gas metre due to this! So after spending around 3-4hours of phone calls to BG over the last week or so I still have not got any further with this gas supply being changed, leaving us not able to use our oven/stove. The engineer ignores my phone calls, Will Brooks ignores my phone calls and the customer service team never get back to me after promising to have the problem resolved. I don't actually know what to do now as no one at BG seems to be able to help us, even though they keep promising to do so. The only time they have got back to me is to ask me for more money for the upgrading of the pipe work which should have been included in the original quote. So far our installation has left us with no hot water or Heating for 11days, 2 football sized holes in the wall which they need to fill in and we can't cook any food... So no Christmas dinner for us! I'm discusseded by the service BG have provided us and I have no clue of how and when we will get everything sorted. No wonder they have such bad reviews on here.

1,"            I do not buy energy from British Gas, but I did request a quote for a new boiler. The quote came in at over £4k, heavily overpriced (we've just had the work completed for just over £2k) but that's not the reason for this review. Our boiler, like many others, runs off a 15mm gas pipe, and ultimately connects to the gas meter via a 22mm pipe. Somewhere between the gas meter and the boiler the diameter of the pipe changes. British Gas insisted that this pipe would need to be replaced, the safety and lifespan of the boiler depended on it, as all modern boilers (mine was very old) would require a 22mm pipe. British Gas recommended a variety of boiler manufacturers, all requiring this diameter of pipe. We had only been in the house a few months and the wooden floor boards had been replaced with reclaimed boards, lovingly restored at considerable cost to us. This pipe replacement was likely to require the flooring to be pulled up, unless we got very lucky and the diameter of the pipe changed in the utility area directly under the boiler. Floor up means skirting boards off, recently decorated walls ruined, a real mess.What the British Gas engineer (who incidently patronised us and bored us senseless for an hour on a Saturday afternoon) failed to tell us was that one of the market leading manufacturers (Vaillant) would only ever require a 15mm pipe, and so installing a Vaillant boiler would certainly not require us to have our lovely floor ripped up. I'm angry because there is no way that BG did not know this, but because they don't have a contract with Vaillant they deliberately pushed us to a partner manufacturer despite this being the worst case scenario for us.Three independent and highly qualified engineers all told us the exact same thing, and helped us safe at least £2k and a lot of upheaval and damage to our property.Shame on British Gas, I will never spend another penny with you for the rest of my life.

When challenged we were told we wrong!Engineer, arrived at 5ish, really nice gut who only got the job issued at 4:15pm............and was unable to fix the leak due to not having the part........result no heating now from that boiler till Monday.Did not have time to look at 2nd boiler as he finished at 6:00pm.So all in all not impressed.............Whilst understanding about not having the part.............having spend all day Saturday waiting for the Engineer, it would have been helpful is someone had had the courtesy to let us know earlier so we could have gone out in the morning and not wasted a day.

1,"            Had a boiler installed by BG 5 years ago. My heating system is single pipe. The BG surveyor recommended a 330+ boiler. In addition he recommended a filter to be fitted to protect the boiler. Both items were fitted in an expensive install. At the time of install the system was not power flushed. After about two years the system stopped working. Had hot water but only heat to one radiator. Called in BG and they said because of my single pipe system that was where the fault was. Suggest I got them in to repipe the whole house. Not a chance after seeing the work BG at already done. The boiler made by glowworm is not recommended for a single pipe system. In addition the filter is recommended fiited on the return as close to the boiler as possible. It was fitted to the flow by the control valves on the first floor. The boilers on the ground floor. The BG engineers said this is how they fit the filter all the time and the boiler was in their opinion OK for a single pipe system. I asked them if they would have brake pads fitted to their car that were not recommended by the car manufacturer. No reply. I have since had a chartered engineer in who teaches Central Heating and plumbing in tech colleges. He is also a qualified gas assesor. He said it was the worst install he had ever seen. BG engineers said it was fine.I have raised the complaint again this year (delayed process due to ill health). Further visits by BG. They still think its a good system. So we have had for two winters no real heating and we are pensioners.I am now going through the legal motions and taking them to court. I want then to replace my boiler.DO NOT USE BG FOR BOILER INSTALLSP.S Found further issues with install that may well breach regulations and yes getting proper engineers in to repipe the house but boiler is leaking and needs replacing.

1,"            I had a new Baxi boiler installed by British Gas in September 2015 and it is now faulty and not working at all (end of November 2015). It has taken several phone calls to both British Gas and Baxi to confirm a date for it to be repaired. The earliest date for it to be repaired is 11 days from the first engineer visit. It is the middle of winter, I have no heating and three young children. British Gas have done nothing to bring the date of repair forward - despite several phone calls. Their customer service and home care team have been terrible and each time I ring I have to wait for several minutes to get through to someone. Details are as follows:1. I first reported to British Gas on Thursday 19 November that the Baxi boiler they installed in September 2015 had broken down2. A British Gas engineer came on on Friday 20 November. He had NEVER seen this type of boiler  before and didn't know how it operated or what needed to be done!!!! (they boiler had been supplied and fitted by British Gas). So he couldn't figure out what was wrong with the boiler. He arranged for an engineer from Baxi (manufacturer) to come out on Saturday 21 Nov. 3. The Baxi engineer came to look at the boiler on Saturday 21 November but couldn't repair it as he didn't have the parts. 4. I rang British Gas to get some temporary heaters on Saturday 20 November. All I got from them at 5pm on Sunday 21 November was a little fan heater to heat a 4 bedroom house and keep my 3 children warm. This was despite several phone calls to the customer service team and the engineer.  5. On Monday 23 November Baxi told me they were ordering the parts. On the same day I rang British Gas customer service and spoke to Lauren who couldn't help any further - despite being on the phone to her for 1 hour. I asked to get a call back and to be given some further fan heaters - no call back, no fan heaters arranged. 6. On Tuesday 24 November Baxi told me the parts were out of stock and they couldn't give me a date for a repair. On the same day I rang British Gas customer service again to discuss alternative options. They said I had to wait as parts had been ordered (although I had yet to be given a date for a repair).  7. On Wednesday 25 November Baxi confirmed that they had the parts but that the earliest date for repair would be Monday 30 November - 12 days after the boiler broke down. This means I will be without heating for 12 days in the middle of winter with 3 young kids! This is simply unreasonable.8. On the same day I rang British Gas to complain that I wanted the date for the boiler repair to brought forward as it was unreasonable to expect a customer to be without heating for 12 days in the middle of winter - especially since the boiler had been fitted only two months earlier by British Gas. They told me that they couldn't do anything as the matter was now with Baxi. British Gas is failing to meet its obligations under the Supply of Goods and Services Act but more frustratingly their customer service is appalling. I would not choose British Gas for any future boiler installations.

Had to wait 35 mins to even get through to book call out. Earliest appointment Monday 08.00 - 13.00 so had to sit waiting in house in temperature well below 10C.  No sign of engineer by 13.00. Waited another 30+ minutes  to get through to BG on phone. Phone call cut off when I explained problem. Nobody bothered to call back though they have all my phone numbers. Engineer finally arrived about 14.45, surly, no apology. Just barked 'delayed on earlier job' without even looking me in the face. Superficial fix - complex boiler behaviour around pressure which was explained to call centre handler - not addressed at all. Very quick visit, engineer claimed breakdown due to loose wire. Really? Well no surprise that boiler broke down again a few hours later. Another 30+ minutes on phone to call centre last night. Promised priority visit today 12.00 - 14.00. Surprise surprise had a call at 13.30 to say they could not make it. Now waiting to hear back about when BG feel they can fit me in. So this is Tuesday pm - I first tried to get this problem fixed on Saturday evening. BTW I am the customer!!!!! All this would not matter if it was a one-off.

1,"            Having been with scottish gas for over 25 years we noticed that the engineers were taking less and less time undertaking the annual service and also we had to phone them to arrange! This year they hiked the annual payment up £69.96, thats up a whopping 20%. In our home a 2 bed semi we have a worster bosh combi boiler only 4 years old, new pipeing, etc. The homecare 400 covered us for pipes,heating,electrics and we were now paying £39.20 per month !! So we decided to look around and Corgi homeplan, after examining the small print, was best at £21 pr month fixed for 3 years.  At first we tried to get scottish gas to match or come down in their price before we switched, no joy.  So this evening we phoned to cancel scottish gas homecare. As soon as i said that i was cancelling the girl was very aggressive and i felt like i was being bulliedafter some time of this andhavibg bedn put on hold for ages i was informed that a cancelkation charge of over £100 woukd be applied plus any charges for any recent engineers visits. The girls attitude was extremely upsetting and on previous calls to scottish gas at no time were we informed of these charges, just that we could cancel at any time no problem.  So glad to be rid of scottish gas now, But will phone to complain re staffs attitude and so called cancellation charges.

2,"            Having recently moved into our new home we took out British Gas HomeCare to ensure that our boiler was covered in the event of a breakdown.  I must admit that it was very easy to book an appointment online and the engineers that visited us were punctual and called prior to the appointment to let me know what time they'd be arriving. If only the rest of the service was as good...After a quick inspection by the first engineer it transpired that the boiler we had inherited along with the house was not in a good state of repair as the heat engine was corroded and leaking. The flue was apparently also damaged and not installed as per building regulations. This meant that British Gas could not commence the HomeCare agreement until either remedial work had taken place or a new boiler installed. The cost of the remedial work was nearly £1,000 so it seemed sensible to investigate the costs of having a new boiler installed.Whilst he may have been a decent gas engineer, the engineers communication stills weren't great so my wife was completely in the dark about what the exact issues were with our boiler.  The first engineer was also unable to provide a price for a new boiler, so arranged a second appointment the following day for another engineer (/salesman) to visit to provide a quote. He also told us that our HomeCare would be cancelled as they were unable to go ahead with the service.The total cost of the quote for the boiler replacement came to £3355.74, however after various discounts (""20% winter warmer"", ""autumn point of sale discount"", and an additional ""authorised discount, valid only for 7 days"") this reduced the final cost to just under £3,000.I called a few local companies to provide a quote so that I had a few to compare, I was shocked to discover that they were substantially cheaper.  We ended up accepting a quotation for the exact same Worcester Bosch boiler as British Gas quoted for, but the local company charged £1,800 all in.  This wasn't actually the cheapest quote we were provided, but the service, pre-sales and engineers from this particular local company were absolutely excellent so we decided to go with them.As the local company were an accredited Worcester Bosch installer they were also able to offer a 8 year parts and labour warranty, which eliminates the need to pay out monthly for the HomeCare agreement provided that the boiler is serviced annually. This eliminates the monthly charge for the next 8 years, saving £1,296!  There's no obvious mention of the warranty in the British Gas paperwork, aside from '1 year complimentary HomeCare'.I really feel that the quotation provided by British Gas was simply extortionate, especially in a situation where it is coming up to winter and central heating is an absolute necessity.  By shopping around we saved £2,200 - and we could have saved even more if we went for the cheapest quotation. I fear for so many vulnerable people that trust the British Gas name, blindly accepting their vastly inflated prices due to the limited time promotional 'discounts'.A few other issues with the service we encountered from British Gas, on one of the two engineer visit they turned the hot water tank immersion heater on without telling us. This has resulted in our electricity bill being 50% higher than usual for that period.We also noticed on our bank statement that we'd been charged by British Gas for our supposedly cancelled HomeCare agreement, so we called to enquire.  It transpired that despite the word of the first British Gas engineer it hadn't been cancelled.

1,"            Decided to get British Gas to install a new combi oiler and remove an old back boiler. Decided to get BG to install the new boiler despite being by far the highest price. Chose them as their representative explained that their installers will be of the highest quality and the aftercare available. In the past we have had a major leek from a pipe after a repair man had coincidently been working in that area the previous day. Hence the choice over the price.What can I say. We had to call a service engineer within 2 days of installation who got the boiler working again and advised me that you need to talk to the installation engineer as it will probably fail again within another couple of days. The installation engineer was a sub contractor not a British Gas engineer. The sub contractors are not even traceable on the internet or any directory.Have heard from a work colleague that he knows somebody who got a quote from an independent company for a lesser amount but only for British Gas to send him the same contractor on their behalf.Anyway the boiler failed again within two days and we had to call british gas again who were due to come out to discuss issues we had with the installation. British Gas have admitted the installation was of a poor standard and to take a quote from the insurers estimator, your wardrobes have been butchered . They sent the installation supervisor out Iain Gray to ask if we were now satisfied the boiler was working. When I asked what was going to happen with repairing the remaining damage, he said that we would have to speak to their insurers regarding the damage caused by the installation. He left the house as quickly as the Italian army in retreat. Wasn't happy with the interview to put it mildly.Anyway now dealing with British Gas insurers. Going to be a long affair. The boiler has been fitted on advice from British Gas in our bedroom wardrobes. Bare in mind these fitted handmade wardrobes cost £4000 less than 5 years ago, the company who fitted them said it is very difficult to replace the two damaged units without the distinct possibility of damaging the rest of them. They are not designed to be taken out as they are all joined together and quoted us on replacing all of the wardrobes. To do this the flue for the boiler would have to be dismantled leaving the boiler inoperable for the time to take to refit the wardrobes. British Gas insurance agent have stated to us  it will take 3 days to refit the wardrobes even to repair the damage. So Centrica insurers have offered us £1000 cash settlement to repaint the ceiling where the incorrectly installed condensate pipe leaked the contents when taking out, the ""minimal damage"" to the chip out the wall paper which will require 1 new roll and the upper half of the  wall to be repainted, out of their goodwill repair the small chip to the flooring as we had not reported this for two weeks after the installation and pay for at least two new wardrobes to be hand made by the bedroom firm and pay the fitter for 3 days work, pay for the gas fitter to dismantle and reinstall the flue in the boiler. This amount also includes compensation for the poor installation.Just to help you decide before you consider getting British Gas to install your new boiler, British Gas insurers have written to us to ask if we would prefer pursuing the damages through the insurers of the sub contracting firm.

5,"            First a very big thank you to our service engineer (8735) who came the same day we called British Gas to say that our central heating was not working. He checked a few things and then said it was the fan but he had no fan in his van for our very old boiler so he got the current one working. Next morning (Saturday) he returned and fitted a new fan. All warm and cosy now.Also the people we called were fantastic. I asked for a call back as the wait time was 4 minutes and within that time they called back. My husband took the call and he spent some time discussing it with them.Sorry for all those people who have not had good service but I was very impressed and would recommend them.

1,"            I called British gas yesterday evening asking for an engineer to come out as our boiler was broke and we had no hot water or heat and there is no other form of heating in our home. They explained that they only make evening calls if someone's life is at risk in the property and as my daughter is 2 and not under 1 she can regulate her own body temperature so its not an emergency!!!??? Wow they don't mention that on the TV advert or indeed when your setting up the payment plan. I was offered an all day call out 8-8  or an afternoon slot 12-8 ??? I took the all day and no surprise it's now 14.15hrs and still no engineer!! I used to rav about your service but honestly I now find it a disgrace. What's the bet the engineer tells me I need something done which is not part of the policy!

My partner took the day off work to have the meters installed as i am on night shift tonight. Waited in and still no call.  Time passed and it got to 2pm still with no confirmation. So my partner called Customer services to find out where the engineer was.   The woman on the phone was difficult to understand but pleasant, she said she was going to put him on hold and find out what was happening. When he was waiting on hold his mobile starts ringing,  i answered it and it was a British gas engineer. He didn't sound too impressed and he said that he has just had the job downloaded to him. I explained that we were on the other phone to British gas, he said so are you still wanting me to come?  well  YES we booked to have it done, why wouldn't we??? End Result he said he will be with us in around 20 mins so around 14:30. I'll give the guy his due when he did turn up at 14:40 he was pleasant enough and we left him to get on with it. although he never left until 17:30 and due to having no electricity or gas at the time,  My partner was unable to cook anything to eat for our 17 month old son or for me before my nightshift.Need to sort out the customer services British Gas!!!

2,"            As cold months are upon us, many have given a thought to whether the heating system is up-to-scratch to keep the house warm. Many went as far as replaced the old systems or repaired the existing ones.I did not carry out the customer satisfaction survey, but the look on the faces of all my friends and colleagues tells me the process has not been without bumps: expensive quotes, days taken off work to watch the engineers, missing parts, false surveys, wrong customer details on the system, just to name a few.If the small local company may not want to invest into a more elaborate system to handle and manage all the upheaval for its customers, it is unforgivable from a large national energy provider who collects home maintenance insurance payments on a monthly basis. They have the resources to make the process smooth and pleasant for its customers, and retain the customer base on the national level. Regularly they show the ineptitude of a short term profit organisation. Everything starts with a customer phone call. Please log that first call with the customer and use it as a marker for the start of a new relationship. You can count your anniversaries together when the relationship develops. The people who take the call should be able to query the system to tell what services you provide and what equipment may go with each type of service. The engineers should have all the information on the portable devices when they visit the customer, they should be able to give options based on the customer’s budget. Keep customer informed on any delays in the service arrangement whether it is a delay in ordering a boiler repair part or running half an hour late for a scheduled appointment. Keep analysing your customer installations and needs on a regular basis. Your database is a treasure to be discovered. It can help you establish the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and hold yourself responsible to your promises and customer expectations. The database can tell how many new customers you have signed up, how many you have lost and how many you have retained. All you manufactures, suppliers, agents, outsourced engineers become part of the supply chain that is transparent and fair for all the participants. If all the foundation blocks are stacked up in the right order, your organization is in control and able to innovate not only with your balance sheets, but also with the future of energy supply. This is just a brief summary of what should be at the heart of an energy supplier organization and how it can be achieved. My request to them would be to analyse on how many points they fail to communicate with their customers, how many customers have turned away from them due to their ignorance, indifference and ineptitude. Review any of the modern ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems such as Microsoft Dynamics AX, SAP or Oracle, and see what features they offer and whether you can implement those features in your systems. The future is bright, the future is warm…

1,"            This is not the first time that I have had to write bad reviews about my homecare agreements I have at several properties 9 Although I am now cancelling them as and when they come up for renewal ) The latest issue i have has , and am now making a formal complaint through the financial ombudsman for, happened at two different properties at around the same time this year , and the outcome was pretty much the same . After a failure on one boiler at property A , british gas were called out the rectify this as the tenant had no heating or hot water. The engineer decided that the fault was a broken heat exchanger and that this was not covered by this policy ?? so decided to shut the boiler down totally without informing me at all . He apparently left some paperwork with the tenant at the property which was never relayed to me . As i rent this property to the local council and they provide the tenant , this information that she had no heating took some time to get back to me but when i did find out I immediately contacted british gas who then quoted terms and conditions ( blah blah blah ) which stated that the heat exchanger is not covered if at any time previously an engineer had identified sludge in the system . I then was told that it had in fact been identified several times and that they had informed the tenant of the property ( which was probably different council tenants over this time ) but NEVER informed me ?? ( the landlord , owner and person who pays the monthly charge for this agreement ) and so i never knew of this sludge which could , and did , cause this boiler to malfunction . Had I known of this liability then I would have had remedial action carried out . After contacting british gas to ask why I had never been informed , they agin quoted that it is only their policy to identify these problems to the tenant and do not send any findings to me . ( They did however manage to send me a quote for fitting a new heat exchanger, and that managed to filter directly to me !!!)I would not recommend British Gas as a company to anybody and am now in the process of chasing compensation on above two cases ( the second property was a very similar case in which they shut the whole system down leaving tenant with no heating or hot water and then decided that the boiler was too old and that the parts were obsolete , something that was NOT identified before i paid a monthly cover fee for some 4 or 5 years !! )

1,"            I have had cover with British Gas Homecare for several years. Last November I had a new boiler fitted which included 'free' Homecare for 12 months. Once installed I asked them to confirm that my standing order would not include Homecare. I got a reply saying they had written to me with the details of the 'free' offer - they had not. I wrote again saying I had received nothing - it was ignored. I finally sent in a formal complaint. This was properly investigated and I received the confirmation I had requested and some compensation.My boiler is now twelve months old and they have asked for a payment for the Homecare. This is understandable but, as my contract states that they will service the boiler and check the system, I wrote asking why this had not been done. This was acknowledged by their customer services who said they had passed it on to the relevant department - as before they have ignored it, I sent them a reminder over a week ago, they have ignored that as well. Finally today I told them that if they did not respond within 24 hours I would post the details on Trustpilot - they have ignored that as well.I honestly believe that they should complete their part if the contract and service the new boiler in the 'free' 12 month period before I pay them any more money. They haven't been here or contacted me for over 15 months.One would have thought that British Gas would have learnt its lesson the first time, when they paid compensation for their incompetence but, clearly, the incompetence remains.Update 7/11/15.Item posted on Trustpilot on Wednesday evening so it was in place by Thursday morning. At 9.30 on Thursday morning I received a phone call from a BG Customer Services Manager who confirmed that the boiler should have been serviced, arranged an appointment for Saturday and gave me some compensation for their shortcomings. A satisfactory outcome bringing the problem to a conclusion.In response to Steve's response to Truspilot (added  3 days after the posting and at same time as the boiler was being serviced) - what utter claptrap, it may be near Christmas but I have not fallen off the Christmas tree. This sort of ridiculous comment only compounds the problem, not solve it. Following BG Customer Services response I was about to increase the stars to three but, given the response on Trustpilot, it is clear that other parts of British Gas still have a long way to go.

If she had an emergency she could dial one number and get it sorted out.My mother lives in a bungalow and I live some distance away so I can't be there to help her . A few weeks ago she had a water leak in her bathroom that was seeping through to her kitchen. I called British Gas who confirmed she was covered and agreed to send a plumber. One eventually turned the next day after several phone calls. He did nothing. He took a quick look at it, jumped back into his van and drove off. The water was still seeping into her kitchen. I phone British Gas the same day and they promised to send somebody to fix it the next day but nobody turned up. That went on for every day for a week. I was phoning them two or three times a day.One woman at British Gas was very rude and confrontional and suggested that I should go round and fix it myself.Another woman gave me the phone number of Dynorod so that I could talk to them diirect as they are the company that does the work. They simply told me they were too busy and couldn't help me.After nine days of arguing and shouting down the phone they eventually sent another bloke round but he just took a photograph with his mobile and drove off without doing anything.Eventually, after 11 days and many hours arguing on the phone they finally sent somebody round who fixed the leak but in doing so he damaged a load of tiles that had to be replaced.I was paying £575 a year to cover my mother's house and mine. Needless to say, I've now cancelled both policies. I can't afford to waste large amounts of money like that.My mother is 90 years old and vulnerable. British Gas told me she would be treated as a priority. Nothing could have been further from the truth. All they care about is taking your money.

1,"            I waited SEVEN months and had TWO cancelled appointments, of which I took time off work for, for a survey for loft and wall insulation. The surveyor made it on the third attempt following the first appointment being cancelled on the day due to 'sickness' and the 'suspension' of a British gas staff member on the second attempt ..... yes, it's all true, or so I was told. Anyway, third time 'lucky' .... when the surveyor did eventually turn up I was told that my loft had sufficient insulation (even though it very obvious hadn't otherwise why would I have gotten him round?) and that it would be very difficult getting permission from the two flats below me for the wall insulation. It went something like this .... ""it'a very difficult getting everyone'a permission, not impossible mind, but very difficult and unlikely to happen"" and that was that ... he was gone. I felt that it had all been a huge waste of my time and was very disappointed. What is the point of offering a service if they do all in their power to not actually carry out that service? It just so happened our AGM for the flats took place soon after and I mentioned about my survey by British Gas. The management company of the flats said they knew of a firm who had carried out such work on properties nearby and said they would make some enquiries. Low and behold within 3 months the lofts and walls have been insulated - not just in my flat and the two flats below me but in ALL THIRTY THREE flats! It wasn't at all difficult to get permission and all works assessed and carried out in less than half the time it took BG to get someone out to survey!! Don't waste your time with these jokers

2,"            This service is not cheap and goes up each time a tenant makes a call out but what bothers me most is the certification process and information supplied to landlords if there is a faultGas legislation changes frequently and has to be applied retrospectively in the case of rental properties this means that even regularly serviced and repaired boiler systems which have not been changed and have been perfectly adequate frequently fall foul of new rulesThe engineer on two occasions now has applied default notices to two of my properties because of this which is frustrating ----however my main complaint is the total lack of information to the landlord as to what the new regulation is that has been breached and what has to be done to remedy it.All that is given is a 'NO' in the safety tick box of the landlords certificate and an accompany letter informing that there is now a safety issueThere is no detail supplied and even a call to the call centre (if you can get through) can throw any light on the subject as the engineer is now several days into the future and probably numerous jobs under his belt cannot be contacted or cannot recall what the issue could be. My tenants are equally clue lessI now have to go through the rigmarole again of trying to find out what the problem is get an engineer back to look at it estimate it agree the job and then get it done. This is presuming that I can get the tenants to cooperate with all this time they are going to have to take off their work to allow access. It is  an expensive service why do we all have to be kept in the darkSurely a short and swift written report via email to the landlord (if they are not contactable by phone ) would help remedy thisFor the second time out of the blue I find I have un compliant appliances in my property without a clue of what is wrong with them or if I am in danger of killing my tenants who have not reported any problems to me and are probably still using the boiler as they require hot waterThis rigmarole is the best argument I have come across for abandoning all gas services and going all electricIt's frustrating getting access to properties as it is to get inspections done not helped by poor communication when there are problems of some undefinable nature indicated only by the word' NO ' inthe is it safty box of a landlords certificate

I have still not received it.Today (1st September), I called the British Gas Landlord team. I explained the situation to an advisor. She could see on the system that a visit had indeed taken place on the 16th December but had not further evidence of correspondence, including a subsequent visit in May. I held for 5 minutes whilst she investigated the matter further. She stated again that she couldnot find records of a subsequent visit.I read out letters and emails from British gas about this. She then stated that she would call back in 10-15minutes to resolve the matter, that was around 4pm. It is now 23.32pm as I write and I have not been called back.Whilst waiting, I emailed an advisor who previously wrote to me to say that a record would be sent shortly. She replied by stating that she no longer worked for the department.This is again poor service from British Gas and a potential breaking of the law as I am required by law to have a certificate. This is totally unacceptable and I will now need to take legal advice. Very disappointing and time consuming, in chasing this matter up.

2,"            My three Homecare policies have increased by 5%, 7% and 19% . On calling to ask for explanation I was told that newer boilers cost more to insure (in conflict with previous info which says old and obsolete boilers are more expensive to repair and insure). BG is completely unable to explain the arithmetic of these varying increases. Asked for a Manager call back - all they can offer is 'within 48 hours' And I am told that a Manager also won't be able to explain the arithmetic of my quotes! Looking for alternative quotes now.

Then Last month (July) we heard nothing until last Tuesday (August 18th) where we received a email that our payment is overdue.By this time my dad is on holiday so I have no choice to pay for him as we both live at the same address. When he returned, I told him about the problem which at the same time he received a red letter reminder sent by post that the payment is overdue. I complained on his behalf and received two similar replies that out previous email address is still on their systems and will contact us on September 1st on the update on their progress, however they did apologise but I don't think it is enough. We never had a late payment and this one is due to their blunder not ours, they should take the blame for our late payment. In fact some of their emails are not even being received at all. I did check Trash & Spam folders in all our working email address and both are clean.

1,"            I am already an existing customer of British Gas Homecare 400 policy for my residential property. I last week decided to take out Homecare 400 policy on a rental property I own and also decided to add on extra's like Appliances Cover x 3, Homer Emergency (Roof, Glazing, Locks, Pests). I was advised online what covers are suitable via the online chat with an advisor and I went ahead and set up the policy online. I made a separate address for correspondence as I don't live at the insured property. This week I received the policy documents through the post, one set to my rental address regarding the Home Emergency cover and another for Homecare 400 policy to my correspondence address but in a name that is not me (only same surname). I called BG numerous times today to resolve and after a long awaited call back I had my name corrected only to be told the email address is also not valid and I must call online support to change this. To cut a long story short, all these wrong details belong to my brother (name, email, telephone number) and somehow BG accuse myself of entering these details when I took out the policy online!!!!Why would I put wrong details????I don't even understand why my brothers details appeared as he has no BG policy and he is not associated to any of the addresses I mention. Complete system screw up and then they blame the customer, total arrogance. Lastly, I has to call the Home Emergency Policy team, which is under another BG company. To ensure my details are correct with them, a rep answers the phone and takes some details sounding half awake and cuts the line on me. I have decided not to call back. I've had enough. All this to set up a flippin policy. I'm considering my 14 days to cancel it all now. How are they going to attend to home repairs and emergencies if they cannot take down simple information.

1,"            I had a visit to service my boiler at the end of June. The engineer condemned the boiler, which was not repairable, and therefore the Homecare aggreement was cancelled. I spoke to someone at British Gas on 30 June and received a letter from them of the same date a day after this. On 5 July 2015 they took a direct debit from my account. I have contacted them several times and individuals in their customer services call centre promise to call back. Only once has someone actually done this. I spoke to someone on 30 July 2015 who promised to call me back but didn't. I have spoken to someone today (11 August) and I am told that I will be paid by cheque but it will take 28 days before I get payment. This means that they will have the unauthorised payment of money from me for over 56 days and that I might have to wait another 28 days to get back back money they should not have taken. I was told the reason why it is a 28 day wait is because payments are sent out in batches because ""it saves them money"". I do not trust them on the basis of their current promises and will be using another supplier in future.John

1,"            My parents received a combined gas and electric bill of just over £1,000 and several threatening letters. When my mother called to query on 25th July 15, she was told by one agent she had to pay it or else.On 30th July 15 - I called up regarding this matter and was told it was an estimate and that we had to provide meter readings. When I asked why hadn't someone called around to do this, like they had frequently done whilst I was growing up, I was told it wasn't BG responsibility to read the meters and they only had to read them once every 5 years and it was the customers job to send in readings! I then gave the readings and advised the meter was changed in 2013 due to a gas leak. The operator assured me she would update all of their records to show the meter readings, new meter number and raised the complaint. She advised that an amended bill will be sent as well once their back office had done their checks.I then received a letter on 7th Aug 15 saying that if I felt that the gas leak was the cause of the high bill I need to call national grid and resolve with them or the BG billing team and if I wanted to escalated the complaint to get in touch by 18th Aug 15 and if they didn't hear back from me by 24th July 2015 they would close the complaint down. I called the number on the letter 9 mins before their closing and asked if they had read the notes from my previous call which clearly they hadn't because guess what I was asked for meter readings again. I refused to climb into our pantry and do it as I already provided the info last week and asked to speak with a manager and was told sorry they have left for the day. Asked for their email address and was told sorry email generic email address. I asked can you get your manager to call me on Monday morning and I will also email in she said no can only do one thing. So basically BG will charge you for inaccurate bills, threaten to take you to court, threaten you that you must pay the bills but they won't correct their mistakes, read customer notes, keep accurate records and resolve the situation effectively and efficiently. Quite frankly trained monkeys could probably do a better job and would know that the time machine hasn't been invented yet and that I can't travel back to 24th July 15 yet so not sure how they can! As soon as this is resolved I will be looking to move suppliers.

He doesn't say anything and leaves quite quickly, without leaving any paperwork. No issue. Or so I thought.Now I am looking to move house and the buyers solicitors have asked for proof that the boiler is ok. So we call BG - after waiting 15 mins + for them to answer the phone. They can't see on the system the engineers report but promise to send it by email. Next day, email arrives...""Our engineer carried out the necessary safety and efficiency tests on the boiler and the hob and found everything to be satisfactory.  However due to the age and efficiency of the boiler our engineer has recommended that a replacement should be considered.""This is unbelievable after 18 months so we call BG. After 20 mins waiting for the phone to answer we get a call centre chappie who basically says ""so what... its the engineers opinion...you will have to live with it""This will probably go legal, andI am venting right now....but honestly...I paid extra for BG to install the boiler as at least I knew it was a quality job for an important piece of equipment...and now this !?!?!?!?

1,"            We signed up to British Gas Homecare 400 and really wanted this to be the best cover we could find, but the service we received when making a claim has been shockingly bad.Our toilet siphon developed a fault so we contacted British Gas who passed the problem on to their plumbing contractor. We agreed upon a morning visit (8.00am to 1.00pm), but as the engineer hadn't arrived by 1.15pm we phoned to say that we had to go out until around 3.00pm. When we returned, the plumber had visited and left a card. We phoned Brit Gas again and were assured that someone would definitely visit that day. No-one came or phoned.As we hadn't been contacted, two days later we phoned once more to find that the job had been cancelled, so we again requested some attention. The plumber duly arrived 5 days later and as he didn't carry the correct part, he cleaned out the old siphon in the hope that it would work - sadly it didn't & the same fault reappeared.We phoned Brit Gas again and shortly after, their plumbing contractors phoned to say that the part would be ordered and we would be contacted to arrange a visit. A morning visit was duly arranged and on the day we waited at home all day until after 5.00pm. We phoned the contractors only to be told that the wrong part had been delivered & the visit had been cancelled. No-one even bothered to inform us.  The correct part did arrive and has now been fitted, but this has caused us no end of stress.Apart from that, shortly after the first engineer visited and hadn't been able to fix the problem, Brit Gas had the nerve to send me an invoice for our £50 excess, for the ""work completed"". As it clearly wasn't completed I declined to pay at that time.British Gas Homecare is a shockingly bad service and no department seems to know what the other has said or done, and we the customer have seldom been kept informed,I'm seriously considering cancelling this service and looking elsewhere.I do have to say though, that both the engineers who attended out home did the best they could do and were exemplary in their conduct - my complaint doesn't extend to them.

One of my clients who has taken over a business 3 months ago both their Gas and Electric are supplied by BG. Due to poor pricing on offer they opted to take their bsuiness elsewhere. BG were informed of the change in good time. They kept objecting to the transfer, the gas took around 1 month to complete the change of ownership generally known in the indusdustry as COT. Electric actually took 3 months resulting in my client being charged 'deem' rate. This deem rate is double their contract pricing. Cosidering that the wholesale price is a small fraction of this BG feels justified in RIPPING their customers off. Both BG and I know what the profit margins are. Todate I have not had an offer to address the issue. Seems that many companies choose to ignore cusomer's plead until it is thrown open into the public domain. Let's see what response I get from this review.

Since that time I have written two letters and had a discussion with 13 people all promising someone will deal with my complaint, but no-one has contacted me.The property I own is empty. I paid £800 to have the system flushed as this is what the engineers were advising. It appears in the process the pipework was damaged and water was dripping through the ceiling. The house is now damp and uninhabitable. British Gas have not responded to my calls and no-one has yet been to see the property. In addition, although I have a current gas safety certificate on the property from British Gas, there is a hole in the boiler. I understand this could leak carbon monoxide. Previously the boiler had a leak and because this was left by British Gas it corroded the boiler and eventually is was agreed it would be patched with sealant. Well this has now worn off. I have had to pay an independent plumber for an assessment of the problems in the property on more than one occasion. He was horrified on the last visit.The house is standing empty because of the problems described above and I am losing money. I have rung British Gas endlessly, and sent letters but they just keep promising someone else will contact me and they haven't.

1,"            A friend and I used British gas as our energy provider for a flat we rented from 2012 - April 2014. Over a year later the company has sent us a back dated bill saying that we have £700 outstanding payment which was never billed to us during our stay at that particular property. Firstly this ""bill"" had no identification of the address of the property for which it was billing us, nor the final meter reading (which the advisors told us to check against our own recorded final meter reading). Having contacted the support team regarding this issue, we were informed they were going to escalate the issue to their specialist team as they had failed to give us enough information and not given us our bill on time. Prior to them re-contacting us with the outcome of this, a direct debit was re-instated by Brititsh gas from my account WITHOUT MY PERMISSION and the outstanding sum withdrawn. We called the company up again to argue that this was despicable behaviour and they have said that they will refund this amount as they had no right to take it in the first place. We are waiting to see if they will actually do this and frankly are stunned at their lack of professionalism. We will never again use British Gas as our energy service provider and would advise others to also refrain. Having done some research, according to the Energy UK Code of Practice for Accurate Bills we definitely do not have to cover payment shortfall dating back more than 12 months if the supplier was at fault (which they were as they never billed us to cover these sums).

Easier said than done, BES kept calling me which I informed them that I was in contract with British Gas on a daily basis these people would call for different information.After numerous calls to British Gas, being passed from pillar to post. the inevitable happen BES took my Electric account, and British Gas allowed it to go even after assuring me on many occasions that my contract was safe.  I then had the unfortunate task of liaising with BES and British Gas, all this whilst I am trying to set up and run my business.  An Erroneous Transfer took place and took months, after hours on the phone to different people, and numerous emails and promises of 'it will be sorted out', in Feb 2015 it was finally sorted and the Electric account came back over to British Gas.  Sorted you think NO !!!I started having letters from British Gas to say sorry you are leaving us, again the scenario started over again this time my Gas account, was targeted and after only talking to a member of British Gas they once again assured me BES can't take and will not take the supply, the very next day, I had a call from BES thanking me for my business, by this stage I am exhausted by the situation my Gas account had been released, I must have had 10 different contacts from British Gas calling to say they are now taking over my complaint.I then had to go through the Erroneous Transfer again. myself liaising with both companies.  British Gas had said there was an error setting up the accounts which led to them releasing my accounts.We are now in June 2015 and the Gas Account has just come back to British Gas.

1,"            WOW I have felt the need to write a review because I am astounded as to how I have been dealt with by British Gas Homecare.I have been a loyal Homecare customer for more years than I have fingers or toes and I have the full cover for all my house. I pay over £50 a month for this service and peace of mind but that as all been chucked out of the window by this latest event.I have over the years had issues with appointments made and it taking 5 attempts to fix my bolier on one occasion. On this occasion it took numerous phone calls and waiting in before the big guns were sent in to correct it. This time they have mortified me.We were woke up with a high pitched noise at 3.30am immediately you think smoke alarm in a daze ran around to see and it turns out it was the CO2 detector. Windows opened phone call immediately to British Gas they promply sent out National Grid. They could not detect CO2 but turned off the gas and said to contact British gas to get all the appliances checked before they could be used again.Phone call felt relieved they put me on a high priority call that day between 8am and 1pm. This pleased me as no hot water no heating no appliances.Phoned them to check they had the correct telephone number at 9am. Received a phone call to say that they could not get there before 1pm as Life and death emergencies had occurred. Whilst I understand this I wonder how many gas engineers were on Life and death emergencies and also I do feel that your gas being cut off and safety checks needing doing is classed as an emergency.Anyway I was assured they will still be attending. 4.30pm phone call sorry we wont be able to attend due to ongoing life and death emergencies. At this point I pointed out that my gas was still on as I had checked. I was asked if I had a life and death condition. Obviously my response was what do you think. After much heated discussion and explaining that if they were happy to leave us with what could be un safe appliances till the morning then I would just have to accept this.He decided to check with his manager. Half hour later phone call under the circumstances they would be out in the next hour. Great he informed me that National Grid should have not left the property with the gas still on he would get in touch with them.Three hours later no engineer phoned once again. This time I was asked if I had called out dynorod really do they not log the calls. After explaining once again he told me it was booked but could be up to 11pm. We had been up since 3.30am this could not happen. Once again I explained what I had been told about being here in one hour at 5.30. He then told me no one would have said this to me. Ok so are all calls recorded I asked yes they are so I asked him to go and listen to the call then because as you can imagine i am scared we have un safe appliances and now to top it all I am being called a liar.In the end I agreed to a call between 10am and 12pm the next day as we were both so tired and turned the gas off my self.I am obsoultely disgusted with this service I could understand if it was not so urgent but according to them IT IS NOT. How can British Gas not take this seriously yes it may be a faulty CO2 meter but until all as been checked how can they assume this and potentially but our life’s at risk.So paying a lot of money a month for peace of mind as just gone out the window.So my 2 hour window today is nearly over and yet another phone call and no one can get in touch with the engineer but rest assured someone will be in touch shortly. I will not hold my breath its obvious I am being fobbed off every time. I seriously have no words left for how I am being treated it is absolutely disgusting. I have explained about my illness that along with no gas no appliances still puts me in this position.Finally after another phone call I get a bothered person who promptly gives me his name and says he will follow this through till the end and will ring me before he finishes to see if its been completed. Low and behold the engineer turns up at 13.30 and all is tested and deemed safe.I feel that if all the staff were like the last gentleman I do believe his name was Richard then there might be issues but we would not be made to feel like this they need to take a leaf out of his book on customer service and they seriously need to address the service they are providing. Its safe to say I will be looking else where for my peace of mind.

As such we have decided to request for the removal of the SMART meter as we never wanted it in the first place. We contacted BG and after being transferred to numerous departments we were told to pay an additional of £228 in order to remove it and if it is faulty, we are required to prove it to them before they send an engineer to check it in order to replace.I don’t understand why were are being charged to remove something we never requested for or wanted but this is driving me mad to a point where we are seriously considering seeking legal action towards BG.

Why did the original engineers not do their jobs property in the first place?

I have had other companies do the CP12's and they do the job right the first time!SO.. after getting the response below, I received my certificate within hours - does this mean despite being told that there was a problem at the property,  there's no problem? Does this mean that the original engineer was correct?  This doesn't give me confidence in your system or your engineers!

1,"            My aunt Glenis is 78 years of age and has been a customer of British Gas and its predecessor for over 50 years. Together with other family members I have tried to persuade her to switch energy suppliers for a number of years but despite struggling financially she has always resisted. She isn’t comfortable with change as is the case with many elderly.Her last two British Gas statements highlighted that she wasn’t even on their cheapest tariff and finally I convinced her to let me look at the comparison sites. I found that she could save between £300 & £400 per year by switching supplier.Based on these figures she agreed to switch supplier.The process was initiated and she received what appeared to be a final bill from British Gas. On closer examination the bill was based on estimated readings, which of course was a nonsense. A few days later a second bill was received which was based on the readings I had supplied.   On examination of the bill I discovered that she had been charged an early exit fee of £50.My aunt recalled receiving a phone call some months earlier from a representative of British Gas saying that she was not on the cheapest tariff and she understandably agreed to switch. She could not recall being told about the early exit fee or whether she received any written confirmation. I could not find any documentation outlining this fee.I was a little confused, if her last two bills stated that she was not on the cheapest tariff what tariff was she on ?.Perhaps a more customer focused company might have thanked my aunt for her loyalty and perhaps instead of charging her £50 might have sent her flowers.I have never had a great opinion of British Gas but my aunts experience has certainly reinforced my views.I don’t know if the Guinness Book of records are interested but being charged a £50 early exit fee after 50 years continuous custom must qualify as a record.Jamie, thanks for the reply which I would describe as bland, unsympathetic and totally missing the point.Generally the nature of a complaint is detailed in the title ( WHAT PRICE LOYALTY) Your response totally ignores that issue and is probably representative of British Gas's attitude in respect of loyal customers.

1,"            I called British Gas after realising I was being charged by both them and my previous supplier. After a lengthy phone call with the previous supplier and checking the details against the details on my meter it was discovered that my previous suppliers were supplying the gas to my flat, and British Gas were not. British Gas had been charging the wrong address (a different flat in the block perhaps) and the meter number they had for me was wrong. I then had a lengthy phone call with British Gas. It took far too long the phone operator to deduce the problem and admit they weren't in fact supplying our address. Eventually when the problem was established I was informed I could not be refunded of the £250 until I had phoned up my previous supplier to find out the MPRN and then phone British Gas back to tell them so they could sort the problem out. I was promised by the phone operator that she would return my call the next day so I wouldn't have to go through the lengthy process of having to explain the problem again to someone else. She didn't call back. I then called British Gas a week later to try and resolve the issue once more (we are poor students, currently have exams and really don't have the money to spare) and the women I spoke to did not believe that what I was saying was true and that British Gas actually are supplying the property (they're not) and that instead of resolving the issue then she was going to send out an engineer. I asked that she looked through the notes of previous interactions on my account and she told me that an engineer had already been booked for me and that I should have been notified of the date. I was not. She then told me there wasn't a specific date on the system and that she would just book it for herself. I'm away to work in Tanzania next week for 2 months and this does not seem like it will be resolved by then. Which is a pretty big pain considering it would be fairly simple to update my account with the right meter details.

1,"            I have never taken to this method of complaint, but cannot see any other way to get a response so that my issues are resolved.I am a loyal customer of BG - this loyalty clearly is only one way given recent events.  Having move house recently, we also migrated across to BG as felt this was the right and easiest thing to do given that there have never been any issues to speak of in the past.  The new house it turns out seems to loose energy and whilst we partly accept this due to single glazed windows, I really struggled to understand how our bills have been calculated given that our costs are now 3 times more than when we moved in 6 month earlier. After numerous emails and calls, we were offered and agreed to move to a different tariff to assist with this increase to our bill and have been waiting for this now since the end of March.  I am so disappointed and feel that we cannot move as now we are in debit due to this hike in price.  A really would not advise anyone to go to BG - we will be moving on unless BG can swiftly sort this out and compensate.HI - A very unhappy and loyal customer.

1,"            I have the top priced Homecare at about £750 per year. I have a dripping tap and am told that because it has a ceramic insert it is not covered. No problem I switch it off at the isolator valve. The the isolator valve for the hot supply fails. I get the plumber out to repair this but he caps it off meaning if I replace the ceramic insert in the tap I cannot get hot water back on.I recall them to put it back how it was before he arrived and in doing this he breaks the seal on the cold supply and is unable to reseal it.Because it is now dripping he cannot reconnect so leaves me with no hot or cold water in my kitchen and tells me he is not allowed to remove the tap as it is corroded and leaves.I contact British Gas Homecare and suggest that the amicable solution would be for them to fit a new tap ( which I already have ) and they reluctantly agree to come out the next day.Next day comes, no engineer, no water in my kitchen.The next day I contact Homecare once more to be told ( after a 15 minute wait ) that it is a terms and conditions issue and they will not fit my new tap for me.I have now had to demand that they return and ensure I have a cold water supply in my kitchen before cancelling my expensive contract which over the years has cost me over  £3000 for a few callouts.The positive side to this is that it has made me realise I would be far better off putting my £65 per month into a seperate account to fund payments to a local plumber should the need arise.Don't throw your money down the drain with Britis Gas Homecare.

From the gecko we started to have issues with deliveries, then the wrong parts were delivered which delayed the job.I was assured in writting that none of my rooms would have to close or that my business would suffer as a result of the installation. My first surprise was that they had sub-contracted the job it wasn't British Gas attending site. My next problem was that the plumbing company contracted by British Gas did want me to close! Any way a long three week installation issued, room did have to be blocked off, we had to close the hotel for an entire weekend as i had no hot water, we then had to pay our own builder to resolve some other issues caused by the installation and it ended costing my business £5,000 not only in lost business but in extra expenses. Not once did i receive a call or any contact from British Gas. I asked for a meeting and voiced my concerns, disappointment and wanted these issues and loss of business etc to be considered or dealt with. Weeks went past without any contact and then today i received an invoice for the final and full amount! I take it they haven't taken my complaints, concerns and extreme disappointment into any factor that they warrant being an issue or feel any responsibility for their customers care of duty!

1,"            Right where do I start. I joined British Gas in July 2012 after buying my 1st home. I chose British Gas as the previous owners had been with the company prior to me joining. I set it up fairly quickly and easily, I was on a variable direct debt when my monthly payments where fairly low for a year or so and fluctuated in the winter (as expected) I then went onto a fixed tariff as I did a comparison on the British gas website and it said my monthly payments would be reduced (which I liked). I didn't see any reduction in this time only online Bills were I didn't know if I was coming or going. The bills where extortionate amounts like over £200 - £300 pcm for dual fuel. Me and my Husband work Full time from 7:00am- 6:00pm at night so as you can imaging we do not used hardly anything. I then thought their must be something wrong so I got a new boiler fitted from British Gas costing almost £3000 in the hopes this would help with my monthly payments, this did nothing! In December 2014 I saw on the British Gas website that they are fitting Free smart metres and that you only pay for the energy that you use, so I applied for one and I got one. On January 23rd we got this fitted and we could see that we where using roughly £2.00 a day for dual. in one month British Gas took payments out of my account 4 times not small amount either £200-£300 at one point I have had to call them up to 5 times alone this year to ask what is going on with my account and having being passed to every Tom, Dic and Harry they came to the conclusion they didn't know why the system was taking out random amounts and even they couldn't work out the monthly payments! They refunded me £52 but took it back out of my account in that same week! I set up a fixed monthly Direct debt of £100 dual fuel knowing that no one is in my house for 11 hours a day this SHOULD cover the cost, also after speaking with neighbours and after they tell me they only pay £45 for both Gas and Electric and who are home all day I thought I must be doing something wrong! So today when my bill came through to me March- May at £381.80 and that I am £133.04 in debt this was the last nail in the coffin. I called them for the numerous time this year and I get passed backwards and forwards to the many departments where I had to keep repeating my story for them to tell me billing will help and then on billing that smart metre team can help and then back to billing during this time I was losing my patience! I asked to be put through to complaints department to which the phone was put down on me! I had to calm myself down and go away from the phone for a while. I called back 1 hour ago and I was  put through the complaints department where a man answered and I had to explain my story again. He threw lots of numbers at me claiming that everything is correct and that this is what I am using and that their is nothing he can do about it, to which I said that I have had a quote from e-on energy for £65.00 pcm for my dual fuel and if they cannot match that I will unfortunately be switching. His reply was No we don't do price matches and they cannot look into mine to get it cheaper. so I said fine! Then he said if their is nothing else that he can help me with he hopes I have a nice day!  Bye Bye British Gas it has not been nice knowing you! Constructive criticism- Sort your staff out!

They have come about 8x to try to solve one problem (a leak) and have never once agreed on the solution, and it is still a an unresolved problem. Are they plumbers? I have no idea. Also, now that they have outsourced to DYNO, nothing is covered either under the plumbing insurance - leaks, hot water tanks, etc.  It is rubbish. I am so disappointed by the incompetence.

1,"            I have recently switched away from British Gas to join a collective deal set up by my local Council. I've just received a final demand letter with no account details on so called them up. First annoyance you have to type In customer ref number then when you get put through the first thing they ask you is customer ref number ???Worked my way through the strong foriegn accent at other end of phone. They said final account has been emailed (checked nothing received).  They then told me with some glee the outstanding amount was not as stated on my letter as they had now added £18.00 late payment fee. (£200 +£18). When I said I would pay it online they hastily offered £10 a month instalments?? When I declined as I want to pay it online they threatened me with collection proceedings if it wasn't paid immediately, charming ! I've also recieved a phone call from their service department saying that when the engineer recently carried out a service and safety inspection the engineer didn't record the visit fully and now needs to come again and carry out another service!!Also I have a second property in South Wales where I was struggling to get an annual boiler service carried out by British Gas as you have to book many weeks in advance and then they still only offer one or two days each week. Much to my amazement they offered me Good Friday so I arranged to drive there the night before (400 mile round trip) only to find a letter on mat sent a couple days before saying they had postpone appointment because of shortage of engineers!!! No phone call, no email, I gave them hard time on phone but they really weren't interested and offered £30 compensation about half the cost of fuel for the trip. When I said I wanted to cancel the contract they offered to change it to call out service only and I get service done by independent Gas Safe engineer - a much better option as they will give specific times rather than the vague half day windows BG give. All you loyal British Gas customers paying over the odds for ever inferior service please don't think twice about switching, they are not the BG of old and many smaller companies offer a better service at lower costs. BG trade on the name and customers fear of switching whilst their customers are paying for multi million pound TV adverts to keep them going. Thank goodness for sites like this so customers may be warned about the reality behind their fluffy TV adverts. I've switched away from BT some time ago because of their applying overseas customer service centres, great shame the giants of Britsh utilities have lost their customer focus.

2,"            I contacted British Gas in the beginning of December 2014 and had an Insulation Survey booked in for 19th March. I was told that the long wait was due to having only one surveyor in the area. On the day before the surveyor was due I received a text on my mobile saying 'Thanks for booking an Energy Saving Survey ...... we will visit you on 08/05/2015 ....'. As you can imagine I was confused as no other explanation was forthcoming as to why the dates had changed. I rang British Gas and was told that the surveyor 'was sick' and there was no-one else to take his place. I explained that I had already booked the day off work and it was too late to cancel, I had also cleared the attic in preparation. Obviously allowances need to be made for sickness but to think that a company as huge as British Gas do not have back-up is unfathomable! On the morning the re-arranged survey was due, 8th May, I received a phone call from BG. The woman was very apologetic and said that my appointment would have to be re-scheduled again. I explained that I had taken time off work (AGAIN) and cleared my attic (AGAIN). After asking what the excuse was this time I was told that 'some surveyors have been suspended'!I now have another new appointment for 10/06/2015. Needless to say I will not be clearing my attic this time and am waiting for the next excuse. If, indeed, BG do turn up this time it will have taken over 6 months just to get the survey done. Who knows how long it will take after that to actually get any insulation work carried out .... hopefully before Winter.

However, recent events go to show that they are an organisation that clearly does not know their right hand from their left.(1) I have, in within the last year, received several letters advising me of work that had already been done! Consequently i have wasted time calling them to find out whether work was actually outstanding.(2) I am yet to receive my landlord certificate for an inspection in February. This in spite of my having paid extra for an additional appliance to be checked. No update offered in spite of my calls to them. (3) British Gas had forgotten about my scheduled service and landlord safety check. This in spite of my having made the appointment in good time. I was, putting it mildly, fobbed off on the telephone after I had waited some 5 hours for an engineer to visit, and told that the engineer had been held up on another job. When one did arrive, I was informed that my job had never appeared on their system and, if the engineer had in fact been delayed, another could have been substituted. I don't care for being lied to.(4) I cancelled one of my agreements having moved house and was told that no further payment would be taken. In spite of this, British Gas still debited £44 from my account. They haven't refunded this nearly three weeks after bringing it to their attention.All in all, terrible service - I would have expected better after 11 years with them.

That was the last we seen of him, I shortly got a text to my phone saying that that I do not have a cover and that I need to purchase one first. I was in distress by then, allow me to say that I have a one year old baby and an elderly mother who was visiting. I was then put through another conversation with someone else from your team and finally got a plumber knocking at my door, it felt like a relieve. However he wasn't planing on fixing my problem, he just looked at it and told me that he only came around to make sure we knew how to switch off main water supply, he told me that it's only two people working in whole area and that there are other customers that don't know how to switch off water supply and the drowning  in their homes. He then said that we will have to wait until Monday for someone else to come around and fix it. I was completely shocked, I couldn't believe that someone who can fix my problem just walking out of my house and leaving me with no water supply. I was crying, I couldn't even wash my baby's bottles or offer her food. A friend suggested that I should try and replace the leaking water joint my self, we then went to our local B&Q and purchased identical parts, my neighbour who also a builder gave his hand on how to. By the end of the day I finally was able to feed my baby and water problem was fixed. I waited until Monday thinking that someone from British Gas team will contact me, it's now 2 month gone and no one and I mean no one bothered to contact me. However we have receive confirmation by post about your service to our home, my only question is who did the job?  I believe that our contract has been breached, and you done absolutely nothing to help and sort this out, I personally would never recommend British Gas to anyone who is thinking replacing their boiler or taking out any cover with British Gas. I still have water marked ceilings to remind me of your service and no hot water in my house.RegardsKristina Maksimenko

1,"            I have been running a business for over 17 years now and British Gas are the worst supplier ever.  They are totally incapable of getting anything wright.  In the last 9 months I have had three different complaints all related to billing and it has taken loads of my time e mailing, telephoning to sort out.  Just when you think its going to happen, oh no, it doesn't, so you are back on the telephone again speaking to some other person trying to sort it out.  At the moment my complaint is about a bill that they are chasing which I paid in February, it is now April and I have received at least three chase letters. The latest letter threatening to charge me an additional £70 late payment charge.  After each letter was received I sent a complaint email, which I got an automated reply for, but  no acknowledgement of the payment which is all I am looking for. This morning I received another chase letter in the post, this time I decided to telephone. After waiting to get through I was told that the payment was allocated to my account, finally.  I mentioned that I had emailed to complain and to date, have had no reply, the person I spoke to said ""they have tried to telephone you"" so I replied by saying I don't need to speak to anyone, just allocate the payment and stop sending me chase letters.  In my experience with British Gas it normally takes about six months to sort something simple.  I'm just waiting for the next chase letter coming through.P.S.  If British Gas are reading this I don't want to speak to anyone you have wasted enough of my time.

1,"            We have had a terrible experience with the above from British Gas. We phoned on eve of Mondat last week as had leak in immersion and losing water from overflow pipe. Advised concerned as leak and also in water meter. They said would send engineer out Wednesday between 8am to 1pm. They visited and went out to get pump and pumped for a while where immersion is and then said part needed but would come back Thursday morning as dint have part. After they went discovered lounge ceiling ruined by the leak and had hike in plaster. Called them sent someone out but told can't stop leak as need part. Engineer turned up Thursday with part and fitted. By Saturday we discovered we had no hot water in house coming from taps and leak back again. Called them and they sent someone out who advised sorry but part they put in needed again and can't check it due to type of part. Told we would have to wait until Tuesday 8-1pm. Advised no good and phoned British Gas as can't not have hot water until Tuesday as son has circulation problems and I'm asthmatic. They then said they would have part earlier but because engineer that came to our house not working until Tuesday we would have to wait.asked why we can't have another engineer to collect part and fix they said no. They said would send engineer out Sunday to look at leak and check absence of hot water so waited again.engineer told us we had been misinformed about hot water restoration. Phoned them again and advised they would call back in a bit. Received no call.  Advised then that in bathroom have no cold water either from tap as when we called them  out for a dripping tap it was broken following their visit. We had cold water before from this tap. They have no respect for the fact that we have no hot water for days and asked if they could help in circumstances of putting us in hotel until they sort this but never got call back as promised. So far we are without hot water in house no cold water either in a bathroom have a hole in lounge ceiling which is ruined paying cost of leak on water meter policy excess for claim to ceiling and loss of no claims bonus. We also gave water dripping from taps as valves not closing due to this and a wet carpet upstairs. Totally rubbish and Gas ruined our Easter weekend.

1,"            I move home and the company supplying was British gas. From day one they were a compete nightmare! I have daft pay as you go meter that had debt on them and not easy to top them up. I called the day I moved in and had a gas card sent in the post and a reset code for an electricty key. Both did not work. After 5days without gas or electricity (with a 5 year old child) they eventually send an engineer out to clear both meters and to provide a way to top them up. The engineer left without leaving a gas too up card so again the gas ran out before I was provided with a card resulting in another emergancy call out due the the £5 running out within a day. I have made a complaint regarding all of this but it appear they have no interest in responding to your complaint. I im currently looking at an alternative to making my complaint as a it's a month later and no reply. I am also in the processing of switching supplier due to the poor customer service received after speaking with a minimum of ten advisors. Training should be invested in training staff on how to speak to a customer and also learn their own departments instead of transferring you from pillar to post. Also their prices are ridiculous, how anyone can afford £5 a day in gas is beyond me! I wouldn't recommend this supplier to anyone! Nothing pleasant about my experience with them...

1,"            I opened an account with British Gas on the 18th of March, and was told I would receive a welcome pack via email, detailing my tariff etc., within a week. I was also told I had a 14 day cooling-off period, should I change my mind about my tariff.On the 24th of March I had still not received my welcome pack (which I don't understand - how long does it take to send an email!?), so I contacted them via their website. It took them a week to reply, and they told me I would receive my welcome pack by the 14th of April (a MONTH to send an email!?!?).I then replied that I expected my cooling-off period to therefore be extended until the 21st of April, but was told no, they understand there was a delay in getting the welcome pack to me, but they would not extend the cooling-off period.I think this is completely unacceptable - my first impression of this company is that they are sloppy and that customer service is extremely poor - surely if you have failed to provide a service within the stated time, you then have to at least try and meet the customer halfway.

The details are with the metering team that it seems is impossible to get in touch with. And they have lost my balance off my old meter. After an email complaining (gave up trying to call again in the end as they were experiencing high volume of calls WONDER WHY ) I had a call back some five days later and was told it would all be sorted that day or the next as she had an engery expert there with her great ! Nothing :( Called today they can see the call I made but there are  no notes and the case was closed by the operator!! I have been told today that the issue will be resolved in 5 days the guy was very apologetic but I really can't believe him because so we're the others they all say it has taken far to long but know one seems to fix it. There is something very wrong when call details are not recorded as they should be and a cases been closed with out the customers consent.

Will send me a quote.   OK fair enough. Quote arrives and seems rather expensive so I phone to ask to be talked through it.  Question ""Can you tell me the make and model of the water tank as it seems very expensive?""  Answer ""No sorry we don't know"". Question ""The inhibitor seem very expensive for something that costs £25 in Wickes.  Can you tell me  why your quote is 7 times as much"".  Answer ""no sorry - that's just the standard price"".   The call centre was very pleasant and sounded rather embarrassed.  Also no labour discount offered considering I've paid £200 PA for 15 years.

1,"            Following on from our horrible experience with British Gas (reported on 16 March on TrustPilot) we raised a complaint with British Gas on 5th March and finally got call from Service manager yesterday (24th March) whose words were: “You were not covered for the electric fault and our Engineers did a correct assessment of the situation and provided correct feedback that there is an electric wire broken between Hot water tank and boiler. Although the local engineer found the fault to be a lose wire on hot water tank British Gas deem a lose wire connection and a broken wire to be the same situation. So British Gas did their contractual and legal duty correctly in sending the £792 quotation. However, he will take up with the Engineers internally as they should have spent little more time analysing the situation but then again it would have cost us an extra hourly rate and could have taken up to 3-4 hours to find the fault” This is despite the fact that the cover was sold by British Gas after consultation with the onsite British Gas Engineer and a Local engineer fixed the problem within 1 min. When I challenged how a broken wire and lose wire connection on the tank be the same situation I was then given the explanation that perhaps broken wire was incorrect terminology it was a broken voltage which again is the same thing. Regarding customer services selling me wrong insurance this is something which he does not deal with and will pass the info to the required department as feedback. Also due to the situation we had to go through his hands were unfortunately tied as FCA rules treat this as a “Lack of Comfort“ experience and British Gas can compensate £30 cash or around £50 towards our next insurance. I am not sure about FCA rules but being without heating and hot water for 3 days when outside temperature is 4 degrees, my 7 year old with an ear infection and me catching severe cold is classed as “Lack of Comfort” is hard to believe.  Also when customers sign for insurance with any company I would like to believe that any issue/ complaint by the customer will be dealt as a company and not a department. Passing the buck between different department is Company’s internal policy and as a customer I would expect a Joint response to resolve the issue. Perhaps FCA need to clarify the “Lack of Comfort” terminology and if we were really lacking “Comfort” during our 3 day nightmare with British Gas.

1,"            We used to be a Home-care customer until I realised that the annual service consisted of nothing more than taking the front of the boiler, sweeping the dust out of the bottom and then replacing the cover... The final straw was the last visit when the engineer carried out the usual farce of a service, and then rather predictably told me that I need a new boiler as water was leaking from the bottom of it. I humoured the guy as he tried in vain to get me to agree to getting a quote and eventually he left. I telephone my friend, who just happens to be a central heating engineer who came round to have a look at my supposedly broken boiler. After about 20 seconds of looking he pointed out the water marks that ran down the wall from the flue where water had leaked in eventually settling in the bottom of the boiler; so the so-called leaking boiler was actually just water that had entered via the flue during a particularly bad month of rain. This was two years ago and guess what, the boiler is still going strong!Don't ever believe these crooks, they are renown for doing this; the engineers are just salesmen and anyone that is stupid enough to pay the ridiculous prices that they charge for boiler installation deserves everything they get! More importantly the only time that we had to call them to fix a problem they failed despite numerous attempts!Having just had our largest quarterly gas bill we are about to dump them, I urge everyone else to do the same and put this once great company out of business!

Being told boiler fault may be caused by sludge so there for not covered under the contract-BADHaving been with them for about 10 years and only having a couple of faults which have required parts changing ( so probably paid them £3000+ over the years) this was annoying. To replace the part including labour was about £200 which although a lot was not to frightening untill told that they would NOT give any warranty on the part or repair unless I have the system flushed as well. Fair enough I can understand that............untill they told me how much for the flush..........£719!!!!!!! plus the original repair costs!!! Over £900 in total. Nice one british gas, reasonable repair cost then whack in the biggy!!Starting to think my monthly payment would be better in an ISA as by now I would have been able to have a flush and a nice new boiler.Now weighing up my options as I don't have £900+ to throw at this

I got a call 16/03/2015 by the homecare manager and he just tried to fob me off and making excuses. He wasn't interested that the dust and dirt etc  behind the fire could put me and my family at risk of fire or carbon monoxide poisoning. Then he told me that if we call them out to get the taps done that our premium will go up. He definitely has issues.So what do i pay for on a homecare policy.

Details1St MarchOur Boiler stopped working on 1st March 2015 afternoon. We called British Gas who booked a Gas engineer to visit the next day between hours of 08:00 – 13:00. 2nd MarchThe engineer never turned up and my wife called British Gas at 13:00 hours and she was informed that the engineer has cancelled our appointment. The engineer was rebooked in slot between 13:00 – 18:00 hours same day. The engineer finally turns up around 16:00 hours. He had a look at the boiler and hot water tank and advised that there is nothing he can do as there seem to be a electric connection problem between hot water tank and Boiler. Maybe the wire between the two is broken and we need to book an electric engineer with British Gas.I contacted British Gas who said that my current insurance does not cover for electric faults between boiler and hot water tank. The customer service fellow advised on 2 option.Option 1: Perform a one off adhoc service with tiered rateOption 2: Perform a Repair and Cover service We decided to go for the Repair and Cover service. The customer service fellow than confirmed the fault with the Gas Engineer who visited our house and issued  us with electric cover. An engineer was booked to visit our house next day between hours 08:00 – 13:00.3rd MarchAs we had problem with engineer cancelling appointment my wife proactively confirmed with British Gas at 10:00 if the engineer will be coming today. She was told that engineer will be give her a call in 10 min. With no calls or anyone at the door she called again at 12:00 and was told they will check and either customer service or engineer will call in 10 min. As no one turned up until 13:00 hours she called and was informed engineer has cancelled the appointment. The engineer was rebooked in slot between 13:00 – 18:00 hours same day. At 15:30 we called again and this time was given number of a company that supplies electric engineer to British Gas and were asked to contact them. We called the number and the engineer finally arrived around 15:30 hours. He had a look and said that he is not qualified for that Job as it requires a specialist who knows about electric connection between hot water tank and boiler. He spoke to his offices and another engineer was booked. This third engineer arrived around 16:10, looked at the problem, called customer service and then turned around and said we are not covered for that piece of work. The work will cost us around £792 + wiring cost as it is a full day job for 2 people. They will have to rip of the carpets on landing area and bedroom to get the wires from hot water tank to boiler. We explained to the Engineer that that British Gas were aware of the issue and advised us to on the 2 costs. Based on their information we had selected the repair and cover option but the engineer was not prepared to listen and kept reiterating that the insurance amount is too small and you need to pay the full price of £792 + wiring cost if we need this resolved else we can call a private electric engineer. It looked like the engineer was in a great rush as he rushed out of the house and even left his tools bag behind. My wife had to call him back to get his tools bag. I called customer service who first said that we are covered for the cost, then said they are waiting on the engineer for his feedback and once they had his feedback they said that the Repair and Cover was for engineer to visit and check the fault and not to fix. I objected to this as the cover is FIX AND REPAIR and not VISIT AND CHECK. Anyway we had to cut short our call as my boy had ear infection due to cold in the house and we had a doctor’s appointment at the time.After doctor visit I called customer service again and this time I was told that we are covered a Senior Engineer has been booked to visit us tomorrow between 10:00 -12:00. He will look at the issue and Fix it. 4th MarchWhen no one turned up until 11:30 I contacted British Gas who first said that an engineer will be with us between 12:00 – 18:00 and when I explained they said they can’t see any booked between 10:00 – 12:00 and after more discussions put me on hold, went to check and later informed the appointment has been cancelled and the Senior Engineer is busy in meeting all day. A note has been left for him to call us to discuss the issue. At this stage we had a house with no hot water and no heating for 3 days and my 7 year old had ear infection and I had caught sever cold. We called our Local boiler engineer from neighbourhood. He arrived at our house, went to check boiler, then went to check water tank, used his tester and pressed at a wire and the Boiler switched ON. The wire coming from the hot water tank was loose. The Local Boiler Engineer fixed the issue within 1 min of arriving and did not charge us for his visit. British Gas are supposed to be a reliable household name for boiler services but judging by the quality of engineer at their disposal a lot of their customers with no other real alternative may already be getting ripped off by their British Gas engineers and customers may be getting sold insurance which is pointless at the time of need.

1,"            There are two points I wanted to made:1.  I signed up Homecare 200 for more than a year, when I signed up this service package I was told I will soon get a an annual service.  Since then, one year had passed, I still haven't received any reminder or phone call to inform me when British gas will carry out my annual service.  So after a year, I phoned British Gas, and was told I need to book the appointment myself.  But this wasn't what I was told at the beginning. I was told, British Gas will contact you to arrange an appointment for annual service when I joined.  Therefore British gas kept the money I paid them but not actually carry out their obligation to complete a service within 12 months.2. When British gas help line told me I need to book the appointment myself, I immediately made an appointment to carry out the service and breakdown repair on a Saturday between 12 to 6 pm.  No one turn up to carry out the service, no phone call to tell me they can't turn up either.  In fact I phoned the help line on the day to reconfirm the appointment and was reassure by British gas they will come.  It is totally waste of money and time for this kind of appalling service.

1,"            I have cancelled my Homecare 300 Agreement today due to the lies the engineer told me when he carried out a repair last week. According to him my boiler ""is now very old and some parts are not available so I should really think about getting a new boiler"". My boiler is just over 8 years old. I contacted the manufacturer to verify the engineer's claims about the parts. Guess what I was told, there is no shortage of parts for my boiler! I was also told that I should also think about getting a magnafilter fitted because my water is ""poor quality"" and there's probably sludge in my system. I decided to ask an independent Gas Safe engineer to look at my boiler. There is nothing wrong with my boiler. I asked him to fit a filter at half the price quoted by British Gas. When he drained down the system the water that ran out was completely clear. No sludge whatsoever. For years I have been told that my boiler had problems when in fact the engineer last week admitted that B.G. do not like Vokera and refuse to deal with them. That seems more like the truth. They are trying the hard sell and lies to get their customers to change their boilers to one they prefer to deal with. Well British Gas all your engineers have done is make me want to get as far away from you as I can. I will never return to you as a B.G. customer.

1,"            I have been with homestart for several years and not had reason to complain before. I rang homestart 2 weeks before Christmas 2014 to request an engineer to come out and repair a faulty tap, the lady on the phone said the part I required would be ordered and they would inform me when the part had arrived.  My daughter received a voicemail days later explaining we needed to contact a firm in High Wycombe who would do the repair on behalf of British Gas,  I am still waiting 2 months later.  The firm in High wycombe never answers the phone and we have left several messages and yet no reply,  I phoned British gas homestart 3 weeks ago and explained I was still waiting, a lady assured me she would sort it out and ring me with a date.  I have still have not heard.  This is not acceptable and I am going to cancel Homestart and considering cancelling my gas and electric with British Gas.

1,"            Signed up on-line September 2014, received acknowledgement but no customer number and details with T & C'S would be sent out in a few weeks.Ended up calling customer services about details after a few weeks and apologised for the delay and that details are being sent. Anyway my annual service was due so I proceeded to arrange one with BG (without T & C'S) all in good faith.Engineer checked boiler and found a fault with the water valve in which I was unaware of when I arranged the service. 'At Risk' notice put on boiler but appliance not turned off ? I ended up paying BG nearly £270 to repair (a week later) on the understanding that service would be completed after (in which it wasn't). If I had been aware of the fault I would have arranged a repair visit and not an annual service.Then I get a letter cancelling and refunding my first two monthly payments without any explanation !  I would have also sought cheaper repair costs from an independant corgi registered engineer if I had of known that my contract was going to be cancelled. I Submitted a formal complaint on 13th November, 2014 and as of today I am still awaiting outcome of investigations !Thoroughly disappointed with customer service and the way my complaint has been dealt with. Then I am not surprised as I experienced the same service 20 years ago when I last used BG !

1,"            It has taken over a year to sort out billing issues where the account went from £600 in credit, £300 in credit to suddenly owing over £800 then over £1k in same month  Finally transpires BG forgot to charge for electric on a dual fuel account and informed me incorrectly.  How can such a large company get their billing so badly wrong, expect customer to magic up huge amounts they were not expecting, ring from India at all hours and fail to understand English then engage debt collectors during a documented customer dispute...BG still fail to explain how a summer bill can exceed £800 in 2013 but lost the will to live in sorting it out. Use a different supplier if you can and that comes from a shareholder!

5,"            We recently had a boiler breakdown we have a Homecare plan and an engineer came out within 24 hours to try and fix it. He spent 4 hours trying to resolve the problem and I could see that it was far from a straightforward job... Our engineer was patient and determined to do his best for us despite a number of problems that evolved as the job progressed.  In the end, he was unable to resolve the problem and reluctantly he informed us that we would need to install a new boiler...  Obviously this was not our first choice as an outcome, but he recommended a British Gas Sales Adviser come over to see us to see what could be done to help us.  When the Sales Adviser came over to the house, at no time during the appointment did we feel that his manner was `pushy'.  We felt that he really did have our best interests at heart and his manner was polite, courteous and friendly..  Having decided that we needed to replace our boiler he offered us a number of payment options and also offered us a discount on the final price... We felt that we were investing in a quality product, that would improve the level of warmth in our home.We had to wait a week for the installation of the boiler (but British Gas did their utmost for us & brought the installation date forward by 3 days)  .  The engineer that came to fit the new boiler was equally efficient, friendly and committed to getting the job done to a high standard and in a timely manner. He also contacted us the next day to ensure that all was well.   It is seldom these days that one receives such outstanding customer service. Thank you so much to both the engineers and the Heating Sales Adviser, for offering outstanding service (all when it was already quite apparent that they were all already very busy.)

5,"            The last time I was a British Gas customer was over 10 years ago and they were a nightmare to deal with.I have just purchased a house, to renovate, and the previous owner / tenant used British Gas.  As I only hope to own this house for around 3 to 4 months (renovate and sell on) I decided to take a gamble and just transfer the supply straight from the previous owner to me.I rang British Gas to explain the situation the week before we were due to complete on the sale and they could not have been more helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble, the whole process took less than 10 minutes to register.  All the tariff options were explained clearly and precisely and I was even told I would receive a £50 Amazon voucher as well.On the day I picked up the keys I received 2 texts from British Gas advising me to simply reply with my meter readings (one for gas one for electric) which I did and the following day I received an email confirming  all the information had been registered and my account was fully up and running.Fingers crossed this is not just a one off and that the account closure, once I sell the house, will be as smooth as the opening.  Just waiting for my Amazon voucher now :)Well done British Gas, I AM IMPRESSED.

This amounted to £100 discount.I called again was passed to three different people each time having to explain my story finally to be promised someone would call me that evening or next day...I am still waiting.I then called engineer who informed me there prices are regulated externally and therefor unable to give further discount. I work for an international company and an aware that price fixing is totally illegal.I would very seriously advise anyone against taking out homecare agreement as it really doesn't give you the assurance you expect.

1,"            I have the homecare policy where I pay £99 excess for any repairs to my boiler.My boiler unfortunately broke down on around 18th January, there was a water leak from the bottom.  I made the call to BG at around 6-6.30pm and paid the £99.00 on my card.  However, as there was no sign of an engineer, I had to call out a local corgi man to stop the leak, as it was leaking onto other electrical appliances - he charged me £40 just to stop the leak!! BG engineer arrived at 11.30pm had a look and said that it needed a new part, he will place an order for it and someone will be out on 19th to replace it.  On the 19th We called at 1pm and were told an engineer is logged, we called again at 4pm and was told engineer is logged, we called at 6-6.30 pm and was told that an engineer can't come until tomorrow! Made a complaint spoke to a manager and was advised that someone will come out.  An engineer did arrive and said it needs a part (we already established that yesterday???) and he can't do anything!!! Rang up spoke to the manager again and he stated that the most they can do is offer us £30.00 cheque for a cancelled appointment and will send someone out with heaters.  Heaters came after 8pm after children had gone to bed!! The engineer finally arrived on 20th january replaced the part and everything was fine- for about an hour!!!! We called to state that the boiler was still leaking, the same engineer came back after a couple of hours and fixed it -  Hooray!!! TODAY I come home to a bill of £99.00 as this was considered to be a second call out - for the same problem their incompetent engineer did not fix properly!! In addition to this they send a cheque out with someone's name that we have never heard off, just their ploy so that the cheque cannot be cashed!!!I will be cancelling everything with british gas and would rather pay more for everything than to have to wait around for incompetent engineers -  all British Gas is good at is ripping customers off!!!

On the 9th January 2015 I had the chimmey swept and found a nest in their so paid for that and called British Gas Homecare to turn Gas fire back on.They came on the 12/1/2015 and did just that turned the fire on did a smoke test it was clear he reconnected the fire turned it on it seemed ok so he left.Then the problems started next day I came home from work to a cold home so decided to turn on the Gas fire it came on and went off just as before the sweep.So called British gas homecare for a return appt as the repair was not complete it was now a continuation job and they agreed to get the engineer back to me and booked another appointment for 15/1/2015 he did not attend the appt again phoning me saying he knows what the problem is and he will get the part i needs and come next week Tuesday 2oth January 2015 again he arrived took my fire to pieces and tried doing somthing only to then state he needs to disconnect the fire again as he has broken the pilot tube and will be back in a few days to replace it.Again I agreed he left and I waited, and waited, andwaited getting cold and fed up I called British Gas homecare to get another appointment for them to finishbthe job they agree.I am given an appointment for the 2nd of February2015 and its the same engineer he phone again telling me the day of the visit that he has not had a job sent to him and he did not no he was supposed to be at my house so can he come another day, Another afternoon of work. Why call a customer on day of appointment and say youdid not no you should be their ok he tells me he is coming on the Thursdays 5thh February the day come and it going but yes an engineer arrives but no nothing about the job and must speak to his offices outside my house.He then comes back in telling me that he can't do the job and thatthey need to find the other engineer who has gone missing, I spend all day chasing the appointment but with no one understanding that my days are being wasted waiting for this invisible engineer , now today the engineer arrives it Friday 6th February 2015 and he comes into my house walks over to the fire and comes to meet me in the kitchen having not doneno work he states again with my part innhis hand that he is now going to lookbfor the part and will call me and he leaves.So he has been actually been walkingbaround with my broken pipe all this timeband iI'm sitting freezing in my home great job .So fromthe 26th December 2014- 6th February 2015 I have had no ags fire at all lost 5 afternoons of work and pay and BritishbGas still have done nothing to replace the part the engineer has broke.Hey guys he just called me the engineer and said exactly what I thought can't find the right part will call you when I can.

I'd had a disasterous boiler service from Aspect Maintenance where they had broken my boiler, came back and failed to fix it, charged me for both visits and then told me it needed new parts.I turned to British Gas who got a guy round the next day. He ran a number of tests on the boiler, identified there was a blockage, cleared it, tested it properly and then it was done. No fuss, boiler works great now, really good experience.

1,"            I've used British Gas HomeCare (Boiler, Drains, Electirics, Kitchen Appliances) for many years and have usually found the service to be reasonably good and reliable.  However, my fridge stopped working on Monday of this week and I telephoned early Monday evening (26 Jan) to schedule an appointment for an engineer.  I had tried to make the appointment through my online account, but was advised to telephone instead.  It took the customer service employee over half an hour to make a 'manual' appointment for Thursday (29 Jan) between 12.00-6.00 pm.  I did not receive a confirmation txt so decided, on Wednesday, to ring and confirm the appointment.  I spoke to Jobi/Jovi who could not find any record of an appoinjtment and again, took a good 25 minutes to sort out another 'manual' appointment, this time for Thursday (29 Jan) between 8.00-6.00 pm!!  So, on Thursday waited, and waited, and waited. At 5.30 pm I telephoned British Gas and spoke to Clare/Clair who confirmed there was no appointment scheduled and by then the engineers had all gone home so there was nothing that could be done. Can you imagine how frustrated and angry I was? NO APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED???  She also confirmed that there was a 'technical fault' on my account which was why I hadn't been able to make the appointment via my online account.  I asked to speak to a manager and was put through to DAVE.  Dave has been trained very well in the art of saying nothing eg 'I don't know', 'I couldn't say', 'I've no idea'.  He did, however, agree that he would get an engineer to me this afternoon (Friday 30 Jan), so I thanked him and arranged to be at home.  I was telephoned by Clare/Clair this moning around 09.30 to say the earliest appintment they could do would be next Wednesday, 4 February.  REALLY?  That's the best you can do?  And what happened to Dave, the useless manager's promise?  I phoned British Gas again and spoke to Claudia, the most helpful person yet - I would suggest you give her Dave's managerial position.  It took her from 10.00 am to 1.30 pm to arrange an appointment for Monday 2 February.  My heartfelt thanks to Claudia for persevering, but what's going on at British Gas that it should take that long to make an appointment? So, do I take another afternoon off in the vague hope that an engineer will turn up on Monday, or do I just buy a new fridge and cancel the worthless HomeCare Agreement?  You're taking my money, British Gas, but you're not providing the service you advertise. For a start, please sort out the technical issue with my account - telling me a lot of customers are experiencing problems because of a new computer system is not solving the problem - do something about it!  Clearly you need to either hire more kitchen appliance engineers or stop offering kitchen appliance cover.  And send Dave on a training course so that he can learn to disguise his apathy.Monday 2 February:  The engineer that was booked in for today's appointment between 12.00-4.00 pm DID NOT TURN UP!!  WHY?!!  For anyone who is considering taking out British Gas Kitchen Appliance cover - DON""T!!

1,"            I have had nothing but problems with what is a simple toilet fix.We initially arranged for a plumber to call on Friday 9th Jan to fix the toilet. He arrived but could only isolate the toilet because ""his van had broken down and he didn't have the parts"". He asked if my Wife, who had specially taken the day off, would be there the following Friday and agreed he would return and finish the job. On the following Friday we received a call from Dyno which surprisingly was to arrange for a plumber to come out. I was told that no appointment had been made and that the plumber could not have made an appointment and we must be mistaken. After a discussion the guy on the phone promised a plumber would come out that afternoon. No plumber came that Friday (16th) so my wife had taken another day off work to no avail. It is clear to me that the Dyno guy lied to me to end the call. I contacted British Gas again that evening but as it had gone past 6pm they couldn't contact Dyno. They took full details of what had happened and promised to follow it up. I haven't heard anything since then. I then contacted British Gas again and was passed over to Dyno who denied all knowledge of someone coming on the Friday and booked an appointment for a plumber to come on Friday 23rd Jan. I rang again during the week to confirm that the plumber was really coming and they said they could confirm it. Come the morning of Friday 23rd I received another call from Dyno saying can they book an appointment for a plumber to come. As you can imagine I lost my temper a bit with the guy on the phone at which point he back peddled and said he was confused and that a person would be coming out that day. At this point my wife had taken three Friday's off to be home for their plumber to arrive. By this time we had been without that toilet for a month and I had lost all confidence that the plumber will arrive.So Friday 23rd arrived. Just to make sure I rang twice that day to confirm that they would be coming and both times it was confirmed. The last time was at 5.15 pm when I was told that the plumber had been given two jobs and ours was the second one but he would definitely be there before 6pm.At 5.45pm I received a phone call saying teh plumber wouldn't be coming now because of some vague emergency work. The guy who called me didn't sound as if he believed the excuse either.  He then attempted to make another appointment. This would represent the fourth appointment they would have made.  I asked if he could come out either one evening or at the weekend. I was told that although they have plumbers who do those times he couldn't authorise one and it would have to be a weekday.  As my wife has had to take three days off already I was not willing to ask her do another day when I have no faith that anyone would turn up at all.I have raised this whole issue with British Gas but so far have had no reply other than a standard email saying they have received my complaint.I am now going to find a private plumber to do the work as I simply don't believe they will ever turn up.So be warned DO NOT BUY HOMECARE 400 you will just be wasting your money.PS just had another phone call from Dyno trying to arrange an appointment. When I explained the history he asked me what should he do ""close the case?"".  This whole thing is beginning to look like one of the cases off That's Life !18/2/15 Additional:  After receiving a letter from British Gas saying they were looking into my complaint have still heard nothing. My bet is they are hoping I will forget about it and the whole thing will go away.

It was very difficult signing up due to system issues.The engineer turned up in the afternoon as agreed, and he was a cheerful chap. He spent 40 minutes working on the boiler, then called out a service engineer colleague - who arrived an hour later. The long and short of it is that they'd fix one fault, but not two faults. It seemed reasonable, but I never found anything in their terms and conditions. So it was agreed it was a no fix no charge situation.Getting the £99 refund was a nightmare. British Gas kept denying that they'd taken the money, but that they'd put me through to the correct department. Obviously - they'd never actually manage to put me through to the correct department. We had no choice but to issue a chargeback/dispute against them. It all left a very nasty taste in the month, especially as the engineers themselves were fine. And we're still in the cold!

I complained yet again and for a long time all I got was emails saying when my change over would take place despite me emailing and phoning there head office. They then sent me a letter asking for my bank details, I wrote back saying I am not a customer of yours and would not be supplying my back details. to my suprise a couple of days later I received another email thanking me for setting up a direct debit. When I phoned to ask where they got my bank details I was told they had copied them over from my old account. 2/3 months on I am still waiting to be put back to my new supplier, but British Gas cant say when.

Since January 2010, our boiler has broken down on at least 28 occasions - a period where our children (now 2 and 4) were babies.  Despite having cover in our policy which entitles us to a new boiler if ours is ""uneconomical to repair"", British Gas are insistent that it is more efficient to send us an engineer (and pay for parts) an average of 6 times EVERY winter than it is to give us what is covered in the policy.  To be honest, I'm not convinced that the policy is what British Gas are really prepared to offer - at least 2 of their employes have confirmed that they have never known British Gas to replace a boiler.  If true, this is clearly mis-selling.  We have just raised a formal complaint and will be taking it as far as we can - including the Financial Ombudsman Service.  My advice to anyone considering using British Gas - pray that you don't get any problems!  As with a lot of other companies today, they are fine until something goes wrong and you need real customer care!

The boiler was only 8 months old so was still under guarantee, but because the company were unable to come till the Monday I did not want my tenant to be without hot water and heating for 2 days so I called British gas in the morning and they sent an engineer the same afternoon. The engineer had a look at the boiler and said the problem is not the boiler but the outlet pipe so he was not prepared to touch it but I was still charged £89 (I thought fair enough as the problem was not the boiler)On Monday when the boiler company (Valliant) came they diagnosed the gas valve was faulty and had it fixed in 25 minutes and has been working without any problems since.

I even spoke to British Gas once again ensuring this had all been set straight. After all this time I had wasted, I was just at peace knowing it had been sorted. But then what happens today..I receive a call from ANOTHER debt collector about this same issue.I am outraged by all the inconvenience they have caused me.

Started 7th August 2014, finished by 4.00 pm (I had cleared the house totally and even taken the doors off). Within 2 days, before I have finished decorating, it had leaked and failed. A call-out was offered --in 3 days--but after 50 minutes of arguing, a plumber called the same day and repaired it--badly installed pump gcoupling. I then inspected it completely--easy as the floorboards were not properly fixed-and found 2 pages of faults--including non compliances with Water Regulations, use of old pipework although they were paid for new, dead legs on water and heating, drains running uphill, safety pipework non draining, 5 radiators fed off 1-15mm pipe, drain rodding points blocked by pipework, washing machine valve and drain blocked by new pipework, 50% of insulation missing or old re-used, etc.After a call to get their inspector out-who agreed with all the defects--2weeks after the first try, they returned and spend over a half a day on remedial work. Again, when repairing damaged floorboards, I carried out an inspection, and found more uninsulated pipes, dead leg still in place but now hidden (!!)  pipes installed where insulation could not be fitted as they were jammed against brick walls etc etc. Another 2 weeks and inspector visit later and they spent another near day on more remedials--and still there were uninsulated pipes, and unsupported pipes and re-used secondhand insulation. We had been out of the house for 4 weeks now, and been repeatedly repairing and sealing damaged floorboards and decoration--but could not move in--- as they needed to get below floors for the remedial work. Their response to date is that they have caused us no compensatable loss or stress. The system they removed was 22 years old and had no faults, and only 2 breakdowns in 22 years. (Fan and circuit board in boiler)The British Gas system lasted 2 days, and has needed 4 weeks out of the house to install and repair all the problems. I did all the inspection and fault finding-- and could have done the installation myself ---10 times over --in the time they wasted of mine.They even left a certificate saying the installation was not earthed--and a number to call to get this done--and another--to say it was done?A collection of GROSS INCOMPETENTS  to be avoided--you can't afford them-the equipment installed was RECENTLY advertised as a whole package on the back of a national newspaper, for well under £1000 recently--and I have lost £1000's in costs time off productive work due to this. EST paid for the installation--as it was meant to be ''energy efficient''--but how, when it was partly insulated, is in doubt??

5,"            I wanted to balance up the reviews on here by saying that we have been with British Gas Homecare for over 20 years and have never once had a complaint to make about service.  It has always been outstanding in every way.  My one tiny gripe this week has been that the renewal notice arrived and didn' t make it very clear that the payments have been increased.  However, although on comparison it is more pricey than other providers I feel that the service received is well worth it.

1,"            02.01.15 our boiler broke down leaving us with no hot water & heating,being a homecare customer I contacted the team,told them I had 1orange & 1 red flashing light indicating its something to do with the flue or fan, i was told an engineer would call Saturday between 12-6pm, fantastic the engineer was here as promised before 12pm great,so far so good, the engineer proceeded to fix the boiler and all was good, well you would of expected this to be good but oh no,as I was at work at the time of the engineer calling my daughter (she's 23) who was home Dealt with the matter,when I returned home I immediately went into the utility room to check the loud noise coming from there, this turned out to be the boiler sounding like a RAF jet, and I noticed the pressure gauge was into the red, I mentioned this to my daughter who told me the engineer in question had said to her "" I've filled your boiler I think""???? Oh yes he'd filled the boiler alright as in overfilled it! And said it was all sorted ,maybe he was hard of hearing if he couldn't hear the stealth bomber heating up, he then proceeded to show my daughter and her fiancé how he controls his heating at home from his phone 😮 what this has to do with my boiler being fixed I will never know! So boiler is fixed....oh no wait it's Monday 05.01.15 and guess what boiler has gone silent so it's checked and yes 1 flashing Orange light & 1 flashing red light indicating it's broken again same problem the flue or the fan so rang the homecare line at 12.15pm and sorted out a call from an engineer today between 1-6pm ok not bad same day call, I can live with this, around 15.50 we received a call to say an engineer wouldn't be with us today as we need a new fan so will be with us tomorrow, amazing how I told them exactly what I told them sat and no engineer call out but they know I need a new fan pure genius these homecare people, anyway I was irate by this time so I called them back to ask why an engineer would not be calling today to be told by the very arrogant rude man on the phone I was not a priority! I asked why I was told I need a new fan without the engineer inspecting it and this was the reason the call was rescheduled for Tues and was told the engineer knows from the previous log that it needs a new fan and I then enquired that if it's down on the last log then why the hell was a job not rebooked or anything mentioned to us Saturday????? Only to be told again all engineers were booked for today, so from 12.15pm -15.50 engineers weren't busy????? I'm very very disappointed with British Gas being a loyal customer for dual fuel for over 20yrs I think I need to reconsider my loyalties!

1,"            This is the letter I have written to British gas,I am awaiting their response.Dear Sir/Madame,I am dismayed and very disappointed at the need for me to write this complaint to you and would welcome your response on the points that I make,British Gas  completed my new boiler installation on 17/12/2014 and I paid the outstanding balance in full prior to the fitter leaving my home, installation took in total over the first two days,12 hours on site,The installation I was advised by your installation representative required a""Flue Plume extension” on the outside wall in order to have the outlet a minimum of 300mm from the boundary with next door,  On installation the fitter pointed it across the wall at approximately 35 degrees and I told him that it did not appear to me that it was correct working practise to do it that way, the fitter merely shrugged and replied,”well that’s what has to be done.” I stated again I considered it bad practice and was not happy.That evening I looked at the flue installation manual, it shows it could have been fitted much more neatly using two 45 degree angles but more importantly it states that the straight line minimum dimension between inlet and outlet must be 500mm........The straight line dimension that the British gas ""Gas Safe” installer had fitted the flue was 320mm!... 180mm below the stipulated minimum dimension.I rang the fitter the following morning 18/12/2014 and pointed out his mistake, he did not express any concern but  ordered two 45 degree bends and stated he would come return and fit correctly next Tuesday morning 23/12/2014.This resulted in me being unable to use the boiler as I was not sure if it was safe or may cause some damage until 23/12/2014 a total of 7 days!That aside I had to insist he changed an extra brick when making good the outside wall as one he wanted to leave in place was damaged, when I pointed this out to him he said “What you want me to change a whole brick merely because of that little bit of damage?” I explained that I wanted the job I had paid for and he reluctantly agreed and changed the brick with a lot of negative attitude and huffing and puffing The bricks incidently ,  I supplied as part of the contract and had agreed to pay an extra £143.17  to have brickwork made good rather than holes filled with cement the fitter only actually had to replace 5 of bricks in total, he did in fairness apologise later, his excuse for his attitude being that he had hurt his back the previous day lifting boiler on to the wall.This fitter has apparently been employed by British Gas for 35 years!!The fitter returned on 23rd as promised and fitted the flue correctly (I hope)I am very disappointed with the service I have received from this fitter and wonder what other things he did not do correctly as I did notice other than the faults previously mentioned the following things….I/ When system was power flushed it was not refilled with softened water even though I have a water softener and had to choose the Gloworm boiler because of this2/The fernox F1 additive was merely tipped into the full header tank and not put into system3/The Bypass valve fitted in airing cupboard leaked and I had to rectify4/The interior wall in the kitchen that the fitter chiselled out to get at the gas inlet was not made good, I had to do myself5/No time was taken to balance the radiators correctly6/No time was spent setting up the spring loaded bypass valve that was fitted7/A 5” hole was drilled into the inside of the sink unit for the condenser drain that is approx. 25mm in size and left..a bit extreme I think.So to sum up, I feel badly let down by British Gas as a company, I paid a lot of money to have a fitter that appeared impatient and bad tempered that seemed anxious to leave the job as soon as possibleI do not want this employee of yours to contact me or come to my home againHis name is Gary Parrot Gas safe registration number 3499496I would like to add that the person that gave me the quotation for the installation was very professional and had no problem with him or your electrician that came to my homeAll British Gas administration and organisation I have found to be second to none, thankyou,I am interested to receive a response from British Gas on these issuesYours sincerelyPhilip Howard

Simple things seem difficult, communication is poor, and you are often kept on hold for long periods of time without being asked.As the CEO of 1Gas, I am also dismayed that we have referred hundreds, if not thousands of customers in the past 5 years and recently on enquiring, British Gas are unwilling to offer supply pricing for our new business.

I found that British Gas had taken 25% more than normal for the December monthly direct debit.  I rang them - waited 17 minutes for a response despite being told estimated waiting time was 3 minutes! - and patient and polite representative finally admitted that there had been a ""systems problem"" and renewal documents to many customers had been delayed.  Clearly they had decided to go ahead and implement price increases hoping that customers would not notice!  Was then told my bill for exactly the same product had gone up by yes, 24.6% despite no call outs in 2013/14.They did apologise and eventually I negotiated a new deal at last years price and had the irregular direct debit refunded.Not a trustworthy company - check your bank statements carefully.

3,"            Very disappointed with British gas (and not for the first time!)I had home care cover as I was told that even though my boiler was very old the parts were still available for it. Engineer came out, didn't even take the cover off. Told me after 5 mins I needed a new boiler as nearly all the parts were obsolete. Then spent 30 mins faffing around on his computer and told me I would still be charged the call out £100 as he has been there longer than 30 minsGot a couple of independent plumbers in to give me a quote on new boiler and one of them got it running again in less than 20 mins and said it was just a dirty pilot light -no new parts required!All in all, very very dissatisfied

It couldn't have been better.

1,"            I currently have dual fuel with British Gas on a PAYG basis. A couple of days ago I realised that my electricity meter was running out of credit. Rather than traipsing down to the shops, I decided to use the emergency credit which is available to the value of £5.00. Today, I put £20.00 credit on the key as the emergency credit was down to £1.18. In effect I had used £3.82 of the EMCR. To my complete disgust, the meter registered only £12.11 when I inserted the key.By my calculation it appears that I have been charged £4.07 for using £3.82 emergency. I didn't even bother working out what percentage rate that is. The person  I spoke to on calling customer service, could only suggest that I call back in 3 working days. I fully intend to do this and also to  contact  my local MP regarding the incident.

1,"            I have just tried to book my annual service (in Nov) and have been told that there are no engineers available in my area until 22nd Jan next year. I have paid about £400 for HomeCare 300 this year. British Gas offer the same service to new customers on their web site for £150, but insist the best they can do for  me is more than twice that. HomeServe offer the same service for £114. In summary, expensive and slow. They are happy to take your money but not to recruit the engineers to provide the service.

1,"            Like others I am not one for writing reviews but after my experience with BG over last couple of days I am at my wits end with them. My boiler packed in on Sunday evening, I rang the home care line and an engineer was booked for Monday afternoon. I explained that I would be at work and that the engineer must ring me 30 mins before his expected arrival so I could dash back. No phone call came and I left early anyway so as to catch him only to find a card through the door saying ""sorry we missed you"".............just great, another night of no heating or hot water. I phoned BG immediately and tried to see if the engineer could still come round but it was quite cleat this was not going to happen and so one again I had to make another appointment for the next day (today) which meant leaving work early again which has not gone down well with my employer. This time the engineer turned up but still only rang two minutes before his arrival and not the 30 as requested. He proceeded to undertake the repairs and also undertook our annual service and all was good in the world again when he left. However, our glee was short lived as the boiler packed in again an hour after he left. Again another call to BG to vent my frustration and the best they can do is another visit tomorrow meaning I have to take even more unpaid time from work whilst we will have gone three days with no heat/hot water. At the end of the day we are paying for a service and in my opinion we are not getting value for money and unless I get some satisfaction from BG I will be looking elsewhere in future. My advice would be to look around before you consider BG for your boiler cover as I sure there are others who will only be to pleased to have your business and that could offer a better service.

1,"            I have never felt compelled to write an online review before but after my experience with using BG, as a gas supplier only, I felt so demoralised it seems like the right forum to vent my frustrations. I won't go into too much detail... suffice to say despite 60 phone calls, broken promises, being hung up on, being put on hold for so long the automated phone service resets, constantly lied too, being overcharged by over 50% of my original quote for gas, which I have barely used since moving into my small flat two years ago, has left me too scared to turn on my heating. Threatening letters and intentionally confusing jargon filled repetitive conversations led me to realise that this why so many people overpay BG. It's no accident.I have been renting in London for 15 years and this is by far the worst customer service I have ever endured, congratulations. You have forced me out of my home as I can't afford to be bullied into paying BG any more.JAMIE IN RESPONSE TO YOUR POST BELOWHi Jamie, it’s funny how BG respond so promptly when they receive a negative review via an open internet forum, if only BG could be that courteous when ringing one their many ""UK helplines"". I am glad BG keep a log of all communications, I too keep records and would be happy to compare? My backdated phone bills would certainly suggest it has been a lot.I didn't want go into specifics about my bill but since you have raised it in your response... I rented a small flat with another person of which I have recently moved out of, I lived there for 23 months, for the first few months the boiler was broken and we had no heating. When it comes to turning on central heating I am pretty conservative with my usage and the flat for most of the time was empty so I can’t understand for the life of me why my account, in total, has been charged £1862.64, for gas only, over those months.I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I have turned the heating this year as we opted to buy electric heaters as a result of this, especially as EDF’s electricity bills were so reasonable. In my 15 years of renting this is the most expensive I have ever had to pay for gas on a total amount, in some cases this bill has eclipsed all my other bills combined.You mention your “goodwill gesture”, I think on that protracted occasion I spoke to numerous BG employees and was finally assigned a “case handler” but I got passed around like an inconvenience, I think I had four case handlers in total, two of which agreed that my bill was far too high, one threatened me with bailiffs and then one finally agreed it was erroneous amount and credited me £198.08 as a ‘Miscellaneous adjustment’ not a ‘”goodwill gesture”’. In my mind it’s still not an acceptable amount but the BG customer service tactics/my phone bill wore me down and depressed me so much I just accepted it.Other utility companies informed me that for my bill to be that high I would have to live in a large house with heating on, not a small flat with the heating always off, anyway I have moved out now and ended my miserable experience with this company.One final issue I had with BG, I had random people turning up out my house taking meter readings. I phoned BG on numerous occasions to retrieve these meter readings only to be informed that BG don’t take meters… who have I been letting into my flat then I asked!? After further phone calls I finally got a truthful answer, it turns out that G4S do meter readings for BG but they had lost all my meter readings as they kept them on different systems. My advice to anyone who is thinking of switching to BG is to AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. It will be a cold day in hell before I use British Gas services again – excuse the pun.

1,"            Currently I use British Gas to supply gas and electricity, service my boiler and provide feed in tariff (FIT) for solar panels.  They have also provided cavity wall insulation. For all but the last of these the service has been good and I would recommend to others subject to the usual checking of current prices. A minor irritation is being required to have two direct debits (gas and electricity) from one energy supplier.They insist in making FIT payments by cheque, and payment has been patchy.  They were poor at first and then improved to pay within the 28 day deadline.  The latest fiasco revolves around the requirement to check the meter every two years.  Apparently this check is done by a third party who have made what appear to be false claims about when they have called.  I have waited in all day for someone who did not turn up at all.  I have been cut off on the telephone.  It is now over three months since i submitted a valid meter reading and over a month since the meter check was done and still no signs of the payment due within 28 days.It appears that the third party is incompetent, but BG should have dealt with this better and it is no excuse for late payment.

Your engineers replaced some parts but left the boiler leaking water.  Still not hot water and was told a new boiler was needed as its fully scaled up etc. I called an independent engineer to quote for boiler replacement and upon visiting he said the boiler was working fine and the only thing wrong is either the pressure vessel valve or diverter switch.  Low and behold when I called your engineer out again and told them the correct diagnosis the Boiler was fixed quickly and is working as it should.  I understand your engineers earn £800 per boiler they sell or con the customer to buy should be the correct terminology.  You really shouldn't be proud of yourselves especially as you are already charging excessive prices for Gas usage. Disgusting. Mr Gopaul

I appreciate that people are more likely to have breakdowns on the approach of the winter period, but surely services could be arranged a little earlier in the year when the weather is less cold in order to avoid this!!  In addition, I have to book a service appointment nearly a month in advance!!!!Something for British Gas to think about!Having said all that, I have to say that EVERY engineer visit that I have had in all the years I have been with British Gas, they have been so excellent!!! Whether it is for a breakdown or for an annual service, the engineers have been friendly, polite, knowledgeable and courteous!!! My last service visit was really good, and the engineer was helpful and kept me informed and did a very thorough job, so very well done.Please British Gas, just get your appointment system sorted!!!!

An appointment was made for 9th September after UK Power Network have done the necessary modification Engineer who visited did not know that the job was for Smart Meter upgrading,he has been given the wrong instruction by his office.Again  another appoinmet was made for the 7th of November,this time Electric Meter was upgraded, and not the Gas Meter. Another appointment has been arranged for 12th November to work on Gas Meter.It is very disappointing that British Gas did not give proper instruction to their Engineers in-spite of numerous telephone calls explaining in detail what is required .I cannot understand why they couldn't  give proper job instruction and send a competent Engineer who could have upgraded both meters in one visit. This has caused so much inconvenience to us.

3,"            British Gas fitted our first system. The boiler was rubbish and had to be replaced after a month with a so called free upgrade which was just as bad. Eventually they condemned it on the basis the cover would no longer seal but denied that the number of times it had been removed for repairs had anything to with the fact it was warped.In a moment of extreme stupidity we allowed British gas to fit the replacement. It caused just as much bother and sits with a mass of extra pipework, air separators and goodness knows what else that allegedly makes it work. On the plus side the engineers are first class and very helpful. Over the years we have become on first name terms with many of them and considered offering bed and breakfast to save them travelling between call outs. Engineers first class, products they sell overpriced  bottom end of the market junk.

So I got through to them today to be told they would call me back - they have notI have now had to top up the meter again and have paid a total of £5 this week off someone else's debt.BG have a 25 minute waiting time for customer calls tonight - sorry but you need to employ a couple more staff BG before you annoy more customers and lose revenue.

He took my phone number and stated that he would call back as soon as his computer was fixed.I asked if he could get one of the other operators to book the service as they were by the side of him and save any more messing about.I was told this was not possible, but he would definitely phone me back as soon as he was able. I am still waiting for these three call backs.I was able to manage a service call via the internet when I had given up on getting any service from your call center.I have a service contract with you for gas, electric and plumming, but that won't last much longer if i cannot contact your departments for any kind of service.Abbsolute Rubbish.At least the bolier service was much better when I eventually booked it.Will certainly not recommend you to friends and family.

1,"            Consistently billed incorrectly, consistently had the website down, made promises they simply could not keep, NEVER read their meters.  If you try to change to another supplier they will extend the time it takes you to the maximum whilst consistently blaming the other party when this is their fault and quite simply a tactic to confuse the issue (which apparently they are well known for doing).  NEVER accept responsibility for their actions or apologise.  When they finally do allow you to change they will not supply you with a paper bill to confirm the meter reading, their website will be down and then you will not be able to check you account, they will then pass it to an indian call centre who will demand twice that which you owe, when you don't respond to their bullying and stand your ground for final meter readings they will hit your credit rating and when you complain about that they will FINALLY send you your final meter readings and ask for a lesser amount in payment.  Throughout all of this they will be unapologetic of their conduct and bullying attitude.  Their service is dreadful, they are expensive and incompetent with their administration.  They used to be a name you could trust but having spoken to many people about this we are all of the same opinion, we are leaving British Gas in our droves and will not return until they amend their ways.

About a week / 10 days later I received a call from British gas asking me to stay and if they matched the price of my new supplier would I stay. As I had been with british gas for years I was happy to accept, it was only when I hang up I realised I would have to pay an exit fee from my new supplier as it was longer than ten days. So I contacted British Gas and cancelled this would had been less than 30mins since I agreed. They accepted and said it would take just over two weeks to cancel. What really shocked me was that BRITISH GAS charged me £60 exit fee for less that 30mins agreement. I was still a British Gas customer until the change over to my new supplier in November, so what was the fee for???????? What a rip off

We are in limbo - no hot water or heating. The electric heaters we were given is consuming electricity like there is no tomorrow and I do not know when this will end. I dread the next bill from you guessed it - British Gas - I am dual fuel.I took a week off work to sort it out and I have just wasted a week of my holiday and the boiler is still not fixed. I cancelled my service a year or 2 ago due to unsatisfactory service and unreasonable increases to  payment. I though I give them a benefit of the doubt and re-instate service but it seems nothing much has changed. I never knew that they would be unable to fix a boiler that is only 4 years old.

5,"            I cannot speak too highly of the service provided by BG. Paul,the main engineer, is a real professional, he showed such great attention to detail on every part of the installation. The other supporting engineers were just as good too. Well done BG!

5,"            I've been a British Gas customer for 20+ years and only had 1 disappointing experience. I've been with my mobile phone company for 2 months and had  6 very disappointing experiences. The phone company should take a look at how British Gas treats their customers

4,"            If i book an appointment they text me or email me. Booking an appointment is easy online. Homecare Service is very useful if you have many appliances big or small. its convenient, quick and hassle free. I would recommend them they are a trusted brand.
        ",2014-10-28T07:40:38.000+00:00
4,"            I trust British Gas, because thay are a quality organisation with excellent after sales service and back-up and you know exactly where you stand with them.  I know they may not be the cheapest but my experience of life and dealing with other companies tells me that you only get what you pay for - a cheaper company sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't - but I am not into gambling with my hard earned money, so I will stick with British Gas.
        ",2014-10-28T07:17:35.000+00:00
1,"            Have a HomeCare agreement but worth nothing if there is an issue they cannot fix. British Gas do not correspond. Advisors on the phone are polite but have no authority and do not take ownership. Service manager we dealt with was very arrogant and refused to escalate after deciding that there is no case to answer. Staggered by lack of customer care. Having two young children in a cold house with no hot water or heating means nothing to British Gas.

4,"            What can I tell you been using British Gas cover for quite a while but its the first time I went on line to book an engineer.  Have to admit it was easy.  Just wish the appointment was as quick as waiting for 4 days to hopefully repair my washing machine.

3,"            The service engineer that came out to carry out our repair was very good and professional.the only disappointment with British gas is that the quote for up grading our boiler to a new energy efficient one ( a straight swap as the salesman said) was high than we paid British Gas for the fitment of a complete central heating system.

5,"            All elements of fitting went well.  No hassles and clean and tidy.   Boiler does however make a louder than previously had ""burring"" noise when on that can be heard in various rooms of the house.  Often wakes me up so this is disappointing - house lovely and warm but extra noise not the best.  Often now cannot have boiler on prior to time to get up to avoid dusturbed sleep.

5,"            Oddly I had to get help to correct two entirely different problems which happened at the same time.  The first was the timer for central heating started turning on and off at random intervals, the other the control panel of my washing machine collapsed into the machine.  Both bookings were made very smoothly for the time I requested.  Both engineers arrived at the specified time.  Both corrected the problems without any fuss or bother.

5,"            We have found British Gas very friendly and efficient, in both their communication by Email for meter readings, and the visits on annual service of our boiler system.Our only critism is not having had a reply to my Email, two weeks ago, asking for an explanation of the purpose of the SELECT button on our UTI British Gas boiler control. Unfortunately we have lost the instruction booklet, and requested, if possible, you could send us another one.

The service was carried out without any disruption and the engineer required spare parts for the radiators so booked a further visit for 2 days later.

4,"            We have called British Gas out 3 times in the past couple of months and each time we have managed to get an appointment within a day, engineer calls ahead as well to let us know he is on his way and has managed to fix the problem in the first visit.
        ",2014-10-27T18:45:14.000+00:00
2,"            Make sure you have plenty of spare time if you need to call British Gas, or a service is due. They seem to need at least a couple of visits to clear a problem, even now I have to get them in to fix yet another problem with the central heating. And £99  excess fee is just a rip-off!

4,"            The engineer who serviced the boiler was very good, checked the service record & gave me valuable information. He adjusted the pressure but failed to check the radiators for air locks which affect the pressure on the boiler & I am unable to adjust this myself because of a disability & the location of the boiler. So the radiators are not as efficient as they should be. He encouraged me to get a Hive & the person who set me up was excellent & left his number in case I need further help - which I do as I just don't understand how the schedule works - despite watching the video so I don't use that. But all in all it was pretty good & I love the hive!

        ",2014-10-27T16:23:22.000+00:00
5,"            BG have a commonsense approach to their operations. A variety of time slots to suit your own availability to service your heating system. Plus, as applied recently, they were working ahead of their schedule and called to ask if they could come ahead of the appointed time if it suited me. Hence efficient use of their time and mine. Quality time served engineers and since I recognise a number of them as having called in past years for the annual service, they also enjoy working for BG and have not moved to another employer.

4,"            I have three services from British Gas, both gas and electricity supply together with central heating boiler maintenance. I have a website account and provide monthly readings in order to pay the exact amount each month. So far since I started this method ( approximately 3 years ago ) it is been working satisfactorily. I am eagerly awaiting smart meters in my area but so far do not have any dates. The smart meters will obviously help me in doing my monthly readings. I have just had my annual boiler service. The engineer was punctual and polite.The only minus was that he needed a spare part which he did not have on his vehicle and I had to wait several days before he could return and fit the part however once fitted he left me with a complete working central heating system. I have ordered the new Hive system and I look forward to having that fitted shortly. Perhaps I might need to do a further review. We shall see, I have every confidence.

1,"            The constant calls from the billing department despite calling their head office to have my number removed from their system. The ""foreign"" customer sales office do not give a monkeys about the British Customer and lie and never accurately record any information given to them. Looking online at other nightmare stories about British Gas should be enough for any sane person to avoid this company at all costs. It is by far the worst customer service of any large company in the UK.I have serval businesses in the UK and spend over £500k per annum with British Gas and after the way they have harressed by partner with calls due to a measly £105 bill being over 14 days late is a disgrace. If British Gas is that hard up for £105, you're now loosing all my business for the incompetence of your customer service.The company is a disgrace, have no working knowledge of the data protection act. When a customer informs you not to contact via phone and to remove their details, failure to do so can have fines imposed via the Data Protection Ombusman and as such I will escalate my complaint to them.

1,"            I phoned British Gas today, to discuss my options for a bill of £242. On the bottom of the letter that was sent out to my house states- ""If you are really finding it difficult to pay us, for whatever reason, you can call us on the number above and we'll discuss ways we can help you"" But this wasn't the case.Now I discussed my financial problems with them, and they didn't want to know. I have made a payment of £120 a month to them without fail. And because my bank cancelled my direct debits due to fraudulent situations on my account in which caused british gas to be cancelled to. I told the agent who claimed to be the manager, in the collections department which I find it hard to believe because I phoned the normal Freephone number 0800-107-1883 that I was unable to pay in full and can they reset up direct debit, they refused. Then they said they will send an agent out to my house which will cost me £54. Then he wouldn't answer my question when I asked ""Why would you send out an agent without making an appointment, without having the knowledge if the customer is in the house"" his reply was ""its standard collection procedure, and if you aren't in then we will send them out again which will cost me another £54"" HOW IS THIS LEGAL!!! without making an appointment, I would understand if I made an appointment and I wasn't in when the agent turned up.Following the phone call british gas did not resolve a problem with me, I told him I was going to make a payment in 7 working days, because I get paid on the last working day of every month. He just ignored what I offered and he told me I will incur more charges for this including warrant charges etc. I told him I am unable to have pay as you go meters put in due to my work and the distance I will have to travel to put money on the keys which will cost me fuel in my car aswel. He didn't want to know unless I made that payment today!. British Gas is rubbish at helping their customers, all he wanted to do was put me into more debt making it more difficult for me to clear this debt. I was treated like a convict, a person I know run up a bill for £3k and didn't get as much hassle as I have!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!

I paid the £50 charge for the option of having the charging point without cable. If I had chosen the cabled option, (which would indicate a higher cost to the supplier), it would have been completely free - bizarre! Anyway having paid the £50 at the time of order, and the order accepted by British Gas, - imagine my disgust to receive a telephone call this morning demanding a £50 payment.

1,"            BG offer a 'top up online' service if you are on a pre-payment meter. Sadly this ONLY works with certain versions of Internet Explorer under Windows. This means those of us using OSX or Linux are stuffed. Bad luck, you might say, but now after believing the lies I am stuck with a pre-payment meter and no online service to top it up. This means a long trip to the shops every time I need a top up simply because BG are too lazy/stupid to make an actual online application and too dishonest to make it clear to customers when they sign up (to me this is as stupid as having a vehicle pick up service at a supermarket, but then stating on pick up that it only works with certain versions of Ford cars).And just to be clear - I am an experienced developer who has worked in similar areas so I know its perfectly achievable. I'm sure you just don't care since most people on pre-pay are poor and/or less technically able.

Several diagnostic tests, 45 minutes and a new timer later the system was fixed. The engineer was polite, friendly, accepted a coffee when offered, informative on the features of the new timer and very helpful, even talking about the history of our building as he's been here a few times over the years and spoken to the architect who used to live nearby.

Problem fixed ok but as usual with his type of boiler (I am told by the engineers) is that it's difficult to balance the system due to a ""F22 Fault"" code (which the manufacturers - Glow-Worm - say should be ignored and removed by them at some point..!! Hi - Lo Temp differential too small and trips ""Fault 22"" cut-off) occuring whilst doing this work.. It is a shame, that although the Engineers report this Fault regularly to the manufacturer, there has not been any up-grade to fix this problem and so re-occurs every year..!!

5,"            Never had a problem in my 43 years as a British Gas customer and never been let down when the boiler needed fixing and never had to wait more than 24 hours when I've called for an engineer. Boiler is serviced yearly under contract and engineers always friendly, knowledgeable and give any advice freely and always clean up when finished servicing. With all the pressure to swap suppliers I've never even had an inkling to change as they don't offer anything better than what I already receive - first class service.

1,"            Like all major utilities British Gas are taking advantage of having little competition and a toothless, ineffective regulator.  They put up prices very early and reduce them very slowly if at all.  Whilst there are cheaper tariffs available, these seem to lock you in for long periods which is indicative of anti-competitive practice. I wish I had retained my solid fuel heating system.
        ",2014-10-06T09:04:46.000+00:00
5,"            Sometimes I wish people wouldn't judge energy companies simply on price alone. BG is one of the two remaining major British energy companies - when you use EDF, you are putting money into the French government's pocket, others are German & Spanish owned!  My experience of BG is top notch (I have several products, not just energy), and their engineers are first rate.  I would stay with BG even if it were the most expensive.  Some things are beyond price.

3,"            the engineer who came to service the boiler came at the very end of the time slot and was clearly in a hurry. The boiler was working on hot water but I had found out that morning the central heating was not working. he said that he could not look at it as he could only do the service but he did arrange an engineer to call out later that week who turned up and changed a motor on a valve when he left the heater was working but when i came to turn it on at the weekend it did not. The next engineer traced the fault to the wiring between the boiler and the room stat and promptly changed it for a new one at a cost of £99 alls fine now. I feel that the first engineer could have sorted the problem if he had more time (the one who fixed it took only 30min on the actual work) or the inclination to sort things.

It wasn't his fault he had an ermgency to deal with, however I would have expected to receive a call informing me of the delay. I had to ring twice to check, mainly because the first call was taken by someone who was so unhelpful and almost rude that after putting the phone down I realised this was unacceptable. The second operator was more helpful but I still think CUSTOMERS should be informed of delays. Certainly wouldn't use you for boiler installation.

4,"            The performance of my central heating system has been poor for at least two years, even though I pay a Home Care monthly amount and have an annual service. Various 'engineers' have insisted that my system is old (the boiler is only 5 years old) and in need of at least a full flushing and perhaps a new set of radiators, not, of course, covered by the agreement. One even sold me a £200 filter which made no difference at all. After much investigation, this engineer 'Mark', discovered that the boiler heat exchanger had disintegrated internally and had shed its lining. Its replacement appears to have brought the system up to a proper temperature again....the winter will tell...

3,"            my first complaint would be the excessive number of calls that start coming through months before the annual service is due, i.e. in the middle of Summer, asking that an appointment be made for the ""annual"" service. Despite repeatedly explaining that the service is not due, the calls kept coming.When the agreed appointment was finally made, the arrangement was broken, promised phone calls did not come and the whole experience was frustrating. The same happened following the service when a replacement part was required (a part broken by the engineer during service), appointments were not kept and I have wasted an inordinate amount of time waiting in for engineers, with hardly an apology - far less compensation.this service was followed up by at least two calls informing me of the age of my boiler and how parts may not be available for its repair and I should be considering a new boiler. I expressed my concern that British Gas would be selling such an expensive item with such a short life span and would now consider moving my contract elsewhere.Not a good experience.

On 15th June Ian Sorely attended our home and carried out a comprehensive survey of our current heating system and our needs regarding a new boiler. He was informative, thorough and explained everything without any high pressure sales pitch. He gave us an all inclusive quote, which was fair and explained exactly what the work would entail.  Installation took place on the 22nd and the engineer (Liam) arrived on time and dismantled the old boiler before the new one was delivered. The workmanship and care taken was impressive and  the boiler and the accessories fitted and in place by late afternoon. No interruption in heating or hot water supply was experienced  and the job was concluded the following morning with all the rubbish removed from our property.Follow up telephone calls ensured everything was to our satisfaction and we are 100% satisfied with every aspect of our dealings with British Gas.

All items of my gas central heating were checked including boiler, radiators, thermostats as well as the gas meter in the outside box.  The system was left in full working order.If I have one critisism it would be that the engineer was quite happy to run up and down my stairs with his trainers on.  Fortunately the weather was dry but if it had been wet then I'm sure my stair carpet would have suffered.  Perhaps BG should issue their engineers with plastic over shoes so they can be worn whenever the weather is wet.

I was sent two letters advising that the money would be take from my account on two separate dates.  On calling to inquire I was advised that these letters had been sent by mistake and to ignore them as the money had definitely been taken from my account.  Strangely enough the money was taken from my account on one of the dates as advised by letter.  I'm really pissed off by the inefficiency of British Gas to give me correct information .

4,"            I have been a customer of British Gas for well over 55 years. I have always found their engineers helpful and skilled. Fortunately in recent years we have not had to contact them.  This tends to show the reliability of their goods and the skill of their engineers.  I have several stories I can recount of British Gas engineers when I first came to live at my current home some 22 years ago.

1,"            I have been treated with courtesy, and the engineers who visit me are polite and helpful.But after four visits to my home in three weeks, a new Hive system, a failed attempt to have a quote on a new boiler, and the address details on my account still incorrect after multiple requests to have them rectified, I have now been without heating and hot water for over four weeks.  Why is this?
        ",2014-10-03T17:32:41.000+00:00
5,"            I recently received a telephone call from British Gas advising me that my boiler was due to be serviced. I was asked if there were any problems, to which I replied that there was a flashing light on a control box. The engineer duly attended, serviced the boiler and changed the batteries in the control box. I was then surprised to receive an invoice from British Gas for £50 to cover the excess on my Homecare agreement. Within a few minutes of telephoning British Gas, a very efficient lady understood the problem and told me that she would make sure the invoice was cancelled.
        ",2014-10-03T17:27:22.000+00:00
2,"            I think the amount of money charged for an annual service for what the engineer did is a rip off. The engineer came looked at the boiler, outside and heater upstairs without touching a thing and spent more time talking than doing that I wonder exactly what I'm paying for. He never checked any radiators and did not seem bothered whether they were working at all.   I would not recommend British gas again nor the service charge.

1,"            I booked my annual boiler service online. The engineer didn't turn up so I called to rebook (and complain). I had to take more time off work for the next available slot. This time the engineer called to say he was on the way. Then he called again to say he had another address on his system (2 minutes round the corner from me) and refused to come over to do the service (or to hang around while I called in to sort it out). So, a second no-show! If you can call it third time lucky, I finally managed to get a visit from a British Gas contractor who was in the area and had checked in to ask if there were any jobs locally.

1,"            Expecting customers to give up half a day for a non-specific appointment is absolutely ridiculous.  We may be post recession but in this day and age and the current economical climate who on earth can afford to give up a day or even half a day's work to be available for your visit.  British Gas should offer at the very least two hour time-slots.  It is a case of the tail wagging the dog rather than the dog wagging the tail.Everyone else seems to manage why can't they.

4,"            My only concern about British Gas is the cost of the service.  The engineers have all been excellent but we are pensioners on a very restricted income and we have to look at every cost critically.  I can't pretend, therefore, that I am not concerned about the level of the profits that you are making in what, to all intents and purposes, is a very restricted market.  I would renationalise all public utilities tomorrow given the option but the Labour Party hasn't the guts to do it.  I can't speak too highly of the people, however.

5,"            We had the engineer from British Gas round to explain how much a new boiler would cost and what one would suit our requirements. He did lots of checks on the items that would be involved in the installation and put our minds at rest that we had made the right decision to choose British Gas .We would recommend friends to consider using British Gas if they were considering replacing their boiler.

It needed a booster plug which he didn't have but a colleague did so he popped out to pick one up. Meanwhile he left me talking to a very helpful Hive specialist from Glasgow, who didn't vote in the referendum, and who talked me through deleting my phone app and installing a Hive app that worked. When the engineer arrived back with the plug, I was on line in my Hive app on my laptop in ""settings"" ready to install the new plug as a device. Worked a treat. I have now got a direct number for the Hive specialist. Great work guys.

The enginers are always helpful, and have always managed to fix problem promptly and without drama. They seem to carry an enormous amount of spares with them too (as long as you've got a fairly mainstream boiler I guess), and on both occasions the boiler was back up and running in an hour or two.

The hot water cylinder and programmer was not checked. I  do not know what the engineer did with the boiler itself as it is situated outside in an outhouse/utility room.

3,"            My only dealings with British gas is my service contract which has become more like an annual dodge the salesman event.A succession of service engineers have called over the last few years offering de-scaling and by-pass instalations for silly amounts of money.I find this quite intimidating and would prefer that the service engineer concentrated on what the job title implies.

4,"            The engineers who have come to fix problems with my central heating have all been prompt and pleasant.  Usually the central heating does get fixed, so that's good.  I read my meter and report online.  In spite of that, a meter reader comes to the door a short time after my reading of the meter!  Why?Also, BG frequently tells me that it is time for my annual servicing of the boiler, whereas the engineer begs to differ about the date for this service.I have Homecare 400 and engineers have come here to try to repair faulty light connections or smelly drains.  Unfortunately the light in the sitting room has never been put right, in spite of the attentions of various BG people over the years.  The man who came a short while ago to investigate bad smells in the kitchen and bathroom sink simply suggested using bleach to flush the drains, since a BG plumber (not drains man) would otherwise have to come out to work on the problem.  I reported the need for someone to fix washers on the bathroom taps and to replace an old, leaking plug-hole surround in the kitchen, but no response has come yet.  Have I been forgotten?A month or so ago there was a major issue regarding a bill - due to failure on the part of BG to contact me about the closure of my account (and the opening of another by BG) when I asked for my lodger's name to be included in the bill (to help the lodger establish her address and thus become eligible for a bank account).  All in all, although I have found BG to be courteous and prompt re. appointments, I do have several bones to pick with the company.  In other words, there is both good and bad in this 'curate's egg' of a company.

He asked me to sign the form but I said that I am not able to bleed the radiator in my dinning room because the whole nut thing turns around. He said oh you should have said earlier but he did not attempt to look at the issue, he just said if you have a high service plan you will be covered and you can call someone out to fix it? Is this good service, I think not.

After repeated lockouts, a callout was made and the engineer could not exion on the internetplain the reported fault but worked on an anomaly which he thought related.  This anomaly still occured, but he considered it expected, and the incidence rate of lockouts was reduced for a couple of months before coming back with a vengeance.  The engineer who then came did some investigation on the internet, identified a possible cause as the ignition strip having been displaced in the original servicing and arcing to the burners, and corrected this.  Since then the ignition lockout problem has not reoccured - for which we are very grateful

4,"            British gas are very efficient. The app is awsome and when I rememberer I submit the readings monthly. Booking my annual service was so easy. It can be done online. . The appointment availablity was far better than I expected. I could have had an appointment next day if I wanted. My only issue (and it applies to all providers) is that they have too many tariffs. Also ages ago they penalised me for not submitting my readings on time.

2,"            We waited in from 8am to 13,00 on two occaisons and no one turned up nor did anyone telephone.Subsequently we had to wait for several days spare parts to arrive.Your complaints team did an excellent job in smoothing very troubled waters.

2,"            The service itself was fine and all what you expected to be completed was done.However the fitter had obviously not heard of hoovering the hearth where the fire was sat do that dust and dirt from the service was summarily brushed up.No hoover (always used by others in the 22 years of servicing) was seen  or used and we had to do it ourselves!

1,"            I am a landlord - I wanted to upgrade my tenants homecare cover to allow them to book repairs with no charge. I contacted British Gas by email - 10 days later they contacted me by email and referenced homecare in a house I have not lived in for years (despite me giving the details of the correct house in the initial email). I emailed back and asked somebody to call me - they didn't. After several days I called them - from Australia as I needed to get my package updated. Phone call was well handled - I wish the emails had been.

5,"            Once again the engineer was smartly dressed, contacted us beforehand with his time of arrival and completed both services with care and diligence. He was very thorough and identified our one problem (with the guard on the exit flue to our fire) and explained what we could do about it. He explained about what current offers were available from British Gas but was not in any way pushy. Exactly the kind of service we expect from this company.

5,"            We recently had an annual service for our central heating. There were a couple of things that were worrying us and explained this to the engineer.  He took on board what we were saying and gave us a number to phone as he was unable to actually do the work himself.  A quick phone call and an appointment was arranged for the following day for the appropriate fitters to come and see if they could fix the problem. Polite and well organised they did what they could to make good the problem.

Customer service ie call centre I usually receive is upsetting stressful rude uncaring. I have to ring about how much I'm paying because £100 per month for one person I think is to high but I keep putting it off because I know It will be such a bad experience.

5,"            Requested call-out between 1-6 pm to look at heating pump.  As promised, the engineer phoned to confirm his imminent arrival.  He inspected the heating boiler and established the pump was working OK.  He then went into the loft and advised that the problem was with the ballcock. He also offered to bleed the radiators (I had already done this).  He was friendly and professional.

3,"            It does raise the larger question of why this wasn't discovered on previous occasions as we have had a service contract with British Gas for a number of years.  In the end it took an improver with a second more senior engineer supervising to discover it.  On that basis I think a more senior engineer should be accompanying all service engineers with spot checks.  I know from experience that people will take short cuts to save time but that shouldn't be at the expense of a good service to their customer who ultimately pays their wages.

He looked at the boiler guide book on line to double check and found he'd already covered all the probable causes. He explained it was unlikely to reoccur but if it did I should 't hesitate to contact them again. I felt very reassured.

Ar 12.30 an engineer phoned to say he would be with us in 20 minutes. He arrived singing and with a beaming smile, he was such a nice guy, he explained everything he was doing. While he was here he did our annual service that was due. He made sure everything was 100% before he left. He was singing and chatting all the time he was here. He actually brightened our day.

Monday came and a different engineer arrived.  He also could not find the fault and spent hours on the phone to Hotpoint.  Eventually after playing with all the buttons said it was ok now and left.  The cooker immediately started playing up again so another engineer was called.  This time the man went through everything it might have been and found the problem.  He managed to order the part but when it arrived the following day it was the wrong one.  The engineer replaced the old one and said to contact him if it should fail again.  So far it has been fine.

But they kept calling and demanding. I called complaints and told them why I couldn't pay and it was heartbreaking. They said it would stop and they would help. But they didn't. It kept on and then a court threat letter was sent.  And added on more debt. Spoke to the manager and he wasn't caring at all. He said all calls automated. I said I was promised to be left alone. Till my promise date. But wasn't. What british gas did was harassment. I told the manager I would write this he is called Deepek. And he said I don't scare him. I can't wait to leave and go with a company who is cheaper,caring and UK based. I am so angry.British gas I was trying to recover from severe shock. You made me worse.

For a brief period of time I had left them because I took the wrong advice. I was tempted by the competitive prices. However, after experiencing lack of customer service and frustration, I decided to go back to British Gas. Whole transfer process went very smoothly. I was updated weekly step by step where I was. I would like to mention the name of excellent customer service representative Steven Debono. After a shocking experience with the previous utility company this was a heaven for me. What I love about British gas they always follow up your enquiries. They are very quick at responding your enquiries and always make a sufficient effort to reach you. The staff are very well trained at every aspect.Their customer service should be taken as an example. I am very happy to be British Gas Customer. 5 STAR FOR YOU!

1,"            We'd been customers of this company back in the 90's; they were useless then when it came to providing customer service from their HO and we didn't expect anything to have changed. (We were right.) So when we moved in to a house on June 10th 2014 that was supplied with both electric and gas by them, we had absolutely no intention of remaining with them. However, as a direct result of mis-leading and or incomplete information (either through incompetence or by design) supplied to us by a number of British G.A.S. employees, the process of transferring to another supplier (which is supposed to take ""around 3 weeks"" according to the Citizens Advice website) has so far taken us in excess of 3 months and we won't be completely free of them until the end of this month. Needless to say therefore, this British, Greedy, Apathetic, Supplier has been able to continue billing us for far longer than they should have. As the misleading and incomplete information has come from several employees, it can't be just us who have had to endure this kind of experience. Given that that is correct, then this British, Greedy Apathetic, Supplier is making a lot of money that they're not entitled to. (Why am I not surprised?) Where are you Ombudsman? Where are you Utility Regulator? If this practice is known to you then you should have stopped it. If it is unknown to you, you're not fit for purpose.

1,"            I've had British Gas Homecare for several years. The odd minor gripe, like appointments missed occasionally, being lied to about the reasons for it, rude (only one, really) service engineer... but last month I got the annual renewal letter. I usually just file it away without taking too much notice, but I happened to look at the price - and the premium has gone up by almost 25% in one year. No mention of the price increase, anywhere on the letter, nor of the reason for it. So I shopped around and got cover for much less (it's only the boiler they're covering, not the rads or controls.) Renewal date is today, and as I have 14 days to cancel from then, my wife rang them while I was at work today, to cancel. Oh no - they can only speak to the person who is named on the agreement, they said. So I rang them this evening at 5.35pm., recording the call (because I'm wise to the usual 'We have no record of your call' scam.) First call, I input my details and was advised there was a 7 minute wait in the queue. (Bear in mind, I'd already pressed the option '4' which is the 'if you're thinking of leaving Homecare' one, so they knew what the call was about, from that point. I hung up after having no one answer at the 30 minute point. My wife explained that she'd got through within a minute, by not pressing any options and simply holding on. I tried the same, recorded the call and spoke to someone within a minute. I explained I wanted to cancel the agreement and he said he'd transfer the call and that I'd be put straight through. Ten minutes later, after listening to the same stupid music, and still having not spoken to anyone, I hung up. I rang again, recording the call. This time I spoke to a girl. I explained that I'd already spent 40 minutes on hold, and wished to cancel my HomeCare agreement. ""Well there's a 3 hour wait for the cancellation department...or you can try again tomorrow..."" at this point I lost my patience, told her that as she was an employee of British Gas, that I was giving her notice that I was cancelling the agreement and to pass it on to the relevant department. ""Oh, I'm sorry, you can't do that - I'm not authorised to take..."" (Me) ""I'm authorising you now - consider the agreement at an end."" ""No - you can't....."" (Me) ""Goodbye."" I followed it up with a letter, recorded delivery. It is quite clear that they put every obstacle in your way to avoid your cancelling the agreement, hoping you'll give up, simply cancel the direct debit (I already have) and assume the agreement is at an end. It isn't - as they'll point out when they write saying the direct debit has been cancelled and no doubt threaten to enforce their terms.Advice to anyone wishing to cancel BG HomeCare - don't bother telephoning; write to them, send by recorded delivery and keep the receipt safe - you may well need it: only crooks carry on in this way

1,"            I have an ongoing Complaint going back to February 2014.  Today I am at my wits end.  A neighboring Property have just been told they are cutting off their power supply from a Meter that is not even on their property.  The meter readings are totally incorrect and the bill is £5518.  I cannot get an answer from British Gas when I say I am going to the Ombudsman as they have not resolved my Complaint in 8 weeks they tell me that the Ombudsman would not be interested as they are still investigating the matter.  They want me to take more pictures of the meters on site all though I have done this 8 times in the past 8 months.  They say it takes 12 days for someone to visit the property.  This has been requested since March 2014.  Please someone help me with this one.Lesley Glover.

5,"            We were approached over the phone by British Gas asking if we would like to be considered for free loft insulation. Why wouldn't we??? An appointment was made and on the due day an engineer visited. The visit was quite thorough and not just having a quick look in the loft. He went round every rom in the house checking on type of windows (double galzed etc,) how many radiators, boiler performance in adition to a thorough inspection of the loft. All the information was logged on his ipad, including lots of photographs. At the end of the visit, he went through his report and confirmed we qualified for free loft insulation. The appointment for installation was arranged there and then, and the rest, as they say, is history. This was well worth the 2 days I spent clearing the loft and taking most of the contents to the local dump. Roll on winter so we can feel warm and comfy in our newly insulated house. Thank you British Gas.

Mainly to do with central heating and boiler.  One little disappointment I had recently with electric fault.  It took 4 visits for them to find out what was wrong and the job is extra  too much.  However even after this experience I would recommend them to my friends.  If the job is covered they keep coming back until they sort it out.

I also have set up appointments and these have been carried out with no problems.I especially like that if you book an engineer visit online, you can choose a 2 hour slot, which means you don't have to be at home, longer than necessary.  Also the fact the engineer phones to let you know, that he is on his way, is another bonus.

Received a phone call from my wife at 11.55 asking if i had a telephone number to contact British Gas as no engineer had called which after receiving 2 e mails the previous day confirming the appointment was not very good. Eventually British Gas contacted us to confirm that the engineer was running late and eventually turned up about 12.20. Presuming that the engineer commenced work at 8.00am how could he be running over 2 hours late for an appointment at 10.00am? - A simple phone call confirming that the engineer was running late would have been the best way to keep the customer informed. We await next years appointment to see how British Gas preform.

Everything went well on the day; the boiler arrived first thing in the morning, followed by the engineer, then the electrician arrived to install the thermastat. No problems at all and a fantastic service.However, since then I experienced a couple of small complications and when calling the ""Helpline"" was informed I did not have the cover needed and my boiler installation was not showing on their screens. Eventually after a few telephone calls, and trying to sort things myself, I was able to get an engineer's assessment.Weeks later I received my Gas Safety certificate and only yesterday received a letter informing me that they'd been trying to contact me about my ""Free upgraded service"" covering electrics/plumbing/ etc,something my original sales-advisor had informed me about but had obviously not gone onto my account.I will call again today to see if I can still qualify for the free upgrade I was supposed to have on installation.Overall, a good product just a little hassle with obvious delays in computer-system updates on their servers.

WHY on earth do we require to replace the boiler? Because the we are over 60's  so try and get as money as you can by the job that's not required!Can any one  please tell me if your partner is getting old dose it mean one has to change it just because you staff is saying so?It would be a very good idea if your staff consecrate on the job in hand rather then looking for replacing something  that's not need replacing.

4,"            We were confident the job had been done but disappointed that the engineer seemed in a rush to get out as it was a warm day. I had to remind him to check the radiators. Not pleased that I had spent a lot of money 3 years ago having my system updated with a new boiler and controls to be told we should have upgraded the tank too. That should have been advised before.

2,"            Unfortunately the actual cause of the probelm was not spotted on the first visit made by the British Gas man on the 14th of May, who arranged to replace the broken hinge.  The unit was still warm, after a further 5 visits it was passed on to an outside firm who came twice and on the third attempt realised that the compressor had gone and the unit needed re gasing removed it on the 15th of August and it came back yesterday the 20th of August.  Whopee.  My fridge freezer is the original 14 year old unit with two new hinges, door and seal, theremostat, light bulb, compressor and now regassed!!!!!!  All the guys have been great, polite and doing their best but it has been a very long time without a working fridge in the kitchen.

5,"            Our gas fire and boiler were due a service. The gas fire is old and frankly needed updating. The Engineered tried to repair it by ordering new parts but in the end it was too far gone.The Engineer identified this, although I could clearly see he was being more than honest, advised us on alternatives and the best private shop to buy a new one from (B & Q) as Britsih Gas don't supply gas fires. Having purchased a new fire, he provided us with his mobile number and as soon as we rang him, he was round to advise us on fitting the fire, where to situate it and what qualifications were needed by the person who we chose to fit it. As it was, British Gas undertook to fit the fire because of certain problems we encountered. The service was first rate and all guaranteed by British Gas. Excellent service, we could not have received better attention. The Engineers attended three times trying to sort us out at the cheapest cost and on each occasion they were bang on time for the appointment and spent a great deal of time trying to resolve the issue.

5,"            After booking the Annual Boiler Service through a smartphone app, I received appointment email and text reminders, plus a call to say the engineer was on his way - he arrived on time and completed the job within their specified time window. He was very courteous and worked without pause until the job was done. He did try to be a bit of a salesman after by quoting me for the 'Hive' remote boiler control system but I suppose they're asked by 'British Gas' to do it so I've no problem in taking a look! All in all, a professional job by a professional company.

5,"            The system for booking an annual gas service is very convenient; being able to choose the date and time on line is so much easier than having to telephone. The engineer phoned in advance of his visit and arrived on time. After the service the engineer explained what he had done and advised me about the availability of boiler parts in the future. The engineer was friendly and very polite.
        ",2014-08-20T22:07:59.000+00:00
5,"            No problems. I have always had really good service form the engineers. He even commented on the cooking smell - I was cooking a courgette and coriander soup which did smell rather good. He said it reminded him of his grandmother's kitchen.I have confidence in the service contract. I hope I will not be disappointed.

3,"            the engineers are polite and try to keep you informed of any changes in schedule. Unfortunately things do not always go to plan. i was happy with my boiler service although it had been delayed by about 2 hours for reasons beyond my engineer's control. Fine for me on that day as I had no immediate meetings to get to. So could be an issue if you don't have a day to spend at home waiting for the gas man...

2,"            They respond quickly but do not investigate boiler faults in depth.  This can result in half a fix. Currently up to my forth visit for a leaking boiler.Appointment times are too broad resulting in too much time taken off work. I'm burning up holidays to support competence issues.Not sure that I'm getting value for money here.

Then  I had a new boiler fitted (RECOMMENDED BY AN ENGINEER)  followed by a service annually which gives me peace of mind. Now I have solar panel fitted best investment I ever made, contributes to alleviate global warming. I really would recommend British gas to you.

4,"            I called about my Home Care agreement.  I have no hot water, but there's no engineer available after 6pm or on a Saturday.  This is a joke when I work full time & need to plan this outside core office hours.  I now have to wait until Friday & then call back again to see if a Saturday appointment is available as they aren't released before Friday.  The lady on the call was understanding & helpful, it's the service provided by the company which I find unacceptable.Whilst checking the website I also discovered if I apply for Home Care 400 as a new customer it's quoted me £17.50 per month.  I currently pay £32.86, which is almost double the amount & can't yet arrange for an engineer at a time which is convenient to me!!!Once this problem is resolved I'll be researching heating cover & will most likely be cancelling this contract with a view to taking it out elsewhere, there's no reward for loyalty & keeping this contract with British Gas!!

2,"            The engineers are great when they attend a call but getting them with in a reasonable time scale is nearly impossible as they seem to be understaffed and unable to cope with the demand.Average waiting time is about 2 weeks which is a long time to be with out an applience especially for a average sized family.Our washing machine has been out of commission for 3 weeks and they are on their second visit a they didn't complete the fix in their first visit.What is worse then their waiting time is their complaints procedures. Still waiting for their complaints department to call me back to close my complaint loop.Their engineering team are fantastic and very knowledgeable but their business and customer processes are more then lacking.

3,"            1. Original problem (identified Sept '13 was central heating coming on when hot water came on. This was ""checked"" and ""cleaned up"".2. May 2014, Engineer did same but suggested if problem persisted, a valve would need to be changed.3.  Thursday, August 7 2014, Engineer arrives as agreed, and suggests a change of valve but does not have the correct valve. Promises to return on Monday.4. Same Engineer arrives as promised on Monday 11 August, drains system, replaces valve and cheeks or bleeds all radiators. That evening, neither heating nor hot water came on and there was no LCD display on boiler, so I phoned Scottish Gas.5. A different Engineer arrived on Tuesday 12 August, he tried to be helpful but was unwilling to do anything until he found out what the previous engineer had done. He was unable to contact him. Promised to return on Friday  with his ""technical manager"". (We were away on Wed and Thurs).6. A different engineer arrived on Friday 15 August, did not know about a ""technical manager"" but troubleshot the problem, indicating there was a fault with the circuit board. I think he consulted with colleagues and the manufacturer and sourced a new circuit board. However, this did not solve the problem, so a faulty fan was suspected. His colleague had a fan, which he promised to fit the next morning.7. This colleague arrived as promised and fitted the new fan, but this did not solve the problem. He suspected the new circuit board was faulty, but was unable to contact manufacturer or get new parts because it was Saturday. He promised to bring the new board on Monday and this would fix the problem.8. This same engineer arrived as promised, fixed the new board and solved this problem. He checked radiators and fixed some minor problems with pins.You are to be congratulated on responding swiftly at each stage, and on your engineers arriving as promised (though each said they did not have my phone number, which your call-staff has expressly asked me for). Each was friendly and the last two took a problem solving attitude, frustrated by being unable to contact colleagues, managers and manufacturer. This left me win no hot water and heating for a week, and having to wait in for, in total, six mornings. This was very frustrating and better coordination and back-up would have minimised this.Your call-centre contact on Monday 11 August breezily asked me, after I had explained that  I was without hot water and central heating following a visit of an engineer for another problem , ""Apart from that, sir, how are you feeling today?"". I told him in reasonably clear terms. After arranging an engineer's visit, he asked, ""Can I help you with anything else today, sir?""  He certainly knew his script, but this was, frankly, extremely irritating as was his overall robotic approach.I would be interested to know how you intend to use this feedback.YoursE Clarke

That was no problem but he did not ring me until 1.15 to say he was on his way now.  I would have appreciated a telephone call before 1pm to tell me he was delayed.

I had to switch it off at the mains.I called at 7.10am following morning and the call centre suggested I booked an appointment on the internet which I was not happy with as the call was made to report a fault caused by your own engineer. Another engineer came in around 4pm and found the initial engineer had left the thermostat in the Baxi turned to max before re-assembly and set it to ""3"" then left. At 1.30am I was woken by the central heating making the same noise but louder and I had to switch it off again at the mains. As the second engineer told my wife what he did to correct the problem we took the decision to turn it down further to ""2"" and switch the system on again. There has been no noise since.

2,"            I stopped using British gas to service my Glow worm Wall mounted boiler because they did not clean out my boiler, they just did a safety check, gas pressures ,flue gasses etc.This is all well and good, but deposits build up in the heat exchanger and need a brush out to give maximum heat transfer. Its a very simple process with my boiler but B.G will only do that if the flue gasses warrant it. My point is that these might be ok on the day but things might change a month down the line. On checking out there £59 summer offer the on line chat girl said they clean the heat exchanger. When I tried to confirm this prior to booking I was told it this was NOT the case.To me a Boiler service should include a simple cleaning where possible as well as just safety checks.Has anyone else had this experience?RegardsColin

3,"            I think the engineer that attended must have been inexperienced as he didn't seem to know what he was doing. He arrived at 11.30 which was good as it was earlier than expected but didn't introduce himself when he arrived at the door. Our boiler is old but it is a hearty little thing and has done us proud for many years. However after forcefully wrenching the cover off and fiddling around for an hour (whilst muttering and complaining to himself about how old and dirty it was and brushing carbon deposits all over our floor) he couldn't get the boiler started again. He even took a personal phone call whilst he was 'cleaning' the boiler and openly moaned about how dirty and rubbish our boiler was. He went outside several times to call one of his colleagues and ended up replacing a part on our boiler with a universal part he found in his van. But the boiler still didn't work and after two and a half hours of struggling he asked me if I would mind him popping back later with his friend. I agreed to this as I wanted my boiler working again.An hour and a half passed and he returned with his friend who was also a British Gas engineer. This guy was the complete opposite of his colleague and was competent, apologetic, polite and had great customer service skills....an asset to British Gas! He proceeded to tell the first engineer that he hadn't even cleaned the boiler properly which is why it wouldn't start and he had also replaced a part unnecessarily. The first engineer then stood about looking very inconvenienced whilst his diligent colleague cleaned and fixed our boiler. A full 6 hours after initial arrival our boiler was working better than ever and the competent engineer informed me what had been done and made his exit leaving the first engineer to complete the paperwork which was equally as uncomfortable.My only message to British Gas is that you are only as strong as your weakest link. If you are going to send engineers into paying customers homes make sure they are competent and courteous at the very least. We don't usually like moaning about things, however we pay a lot of money each year for the HomeCare service and had it not been for the attendance of the second engineer we would probably still have a broken boiler. It has made us question if our money is being well spent....

3,"            Hi there.  I have been a British Gas Homecare customer for years and years.  Although it is hugely expensive to cover my central heating and electric, drains and applicnaces it is worth it due to the standard of workmanship by the engineers.  In all the years I have had my contract the engineers have never let me down.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the back office.  When making an appointment, their system is old fashioned and inflexible and I know for a fact that the engineers often only get a job sent to them at the last minute, when the customer service department have confirmed categorically that the appointment was booked and an engineer was on his way.  That said, I wouldn't move as the gas engineer who covers our area, (Derek), is so good at repairs to my boiler and Aga that I am probably never going to move.  The team on the ground, electricians, gas engineers, drain specialists are the only thing that keeps me with British Gas.

3,"            1. Plumber booked for pm 12 August and I'm advised by text message that I will be contacted by him/her prior to visit. 2. 17.15 hrs telephoned to find out what was happening to be told that the plumber couldn't do the job as no one was at home - I was and neither my land line nor mobile phone had rung. Arranged another visit for first job am 14 August.3. 18.00 hrs approx contacted by office to say the plumber was on his way. Explained another appointment had been made and person on the phone said it was her fault he'd not arrived originally as she'd given the wrong number (telephone or address? I don't know).4. 08.20 the next day (13 August), call on land line from plumber to say he was on his way. Panic from me as I had a hospital appointment in an hour so wouldn't be able to stay at home if the job wasn't finished. Explained he was due the next day (14 August) and he said he'd check with office to find out what was going on.5. I rang the office to see that I'd got the appointment right, was told I had and that the plumber had been given the wrong information.6. Can't report on repair to water leak as it hasn't been done yet. Just hope the office gets it right this time and the plumber turns up. I'm quite surprised as, previously, I've always found British Gas Homecare to be very efficient.

3,"            So it was the annual boiler service and I couldn't forget as I received about 6 reminder emails and about a dozen text messages! I was expecting to be told not all parts available as it's an older boiler followed by the offer of buying a new one from British Gas. However I didn't get that this time, instead comments about recent decoration to where the boiler is house was made pointing out there could be an issue if repairs were needed although this did not affect the service of the boiler. A big deal was made out of this ""potential"" issue if repairs were needed later - he must have said it 5 times - I'm not deaf or senile and did understand the first time! I also did not need him to start walking up the stairs with his outside boots on whilst telling me about the potential issue with disturbing the decorating. I had to ask if the radiators had been checked at which point he continued to walk up the stairs of my new pale coloured carpet with his outside boots on. I had to ask him to remove them and then found myself justifying the request which is just good manners to remove your shoes in anyone's house. The BT engineer had automatically removed his shoes when attending to a fault.  For what little was done to the radiators I could have checked them myself anyway. To top the visit off when I went downstairs discovered his laptop plugged into my electricity which I pay the bill for.  He hadn't even had the courtesy to ask if he could do plug it in. What will happen with the next engineer - will they be making themselves a cup of tea or maybe they'll curl up on my bed and have a nap.  Common courtesy and manners cost nothing but mean everything.

He said he would arrive on Thurs early morning.Checked with BG on the Wed afternoon and was told the engineer would arrive on Thurs between 8am and 10am.Never turned up, BG said engineer had called in sick but another engineer will be with you at 11am.  Never turned up.   BG said the engineer would now not be out until the afternoon between 12 and 6.  Cover had to be arranged for 8am to 10pm then extended, then extended again costing time and money.Engineer eventually turned up at 12.45 and boiler got fixed (the engineer was very helpful and courteous)The whole thing caused considerable distress.  Unhelpful staff on the phone who clearly lied.   What if it had been winter time?   Poor service considering the amount of money paid over the years on Homecare.

The previous Brit Gas engineer I had, when I mentioned a few small issues to him, he investigated them, endeavoured to correct them and provided a full explanation of what he had done and what might need to happen in the future if his remedial actions did not permanently fix the issue.

3,"            We have had a problem with our radiators not heating up. They worked OK prior to a new divertor switch being installed in the boiler. Gas engineers said we needed a power flush but British Gas prices are over inflated. Local heating engineer carried out the work at a more realistic price. The power flush didnt resolve problem. Next heating engineer told us it was our room thermostat. He changes a perfectly good digital thermostat for a cheap end basic model. (I was not too happy with this down grade). Our radiators are still not hot like they used to be. British gas still taking money for breakdown cover though. I really hope that someone from management reads this and helps resolve my heating issues. There is plenty competition out there for boiler / heating maintenance.

A futher 20 mins passed and he came back downstairs, handed me my paperwork and left, i went into the kitchen to turn my washing machine back on and found my kitchen half flooded with a terrible leak coming from under my sink.  i quickly turned the stop tap off and ran outside and shouted him back, he took one look, as i turned the pressure back on to show him and opened his laptop, looked at me and said ""unfortunately mate your not covered for plumbing so theres nothing i can do, you need to phone a plumber"", picked up his stuff and left, leaving me with no running water and a flooded kitchen.i immediately phoned british gas to tell them what had happened, at first they seemed genuinely concerned and put me on hold while they phoned the engineer, about 20 mins later they came back on the line and said the engineer says he did not cause the problem, however there was no leak in the kitchen before he came and the kitchen was flooded when he left. after 10 mins of me explaining he must have done something to cause it they then said, well you dont have plumbing care anyway Mr Thompson so there isnt anything they can do... by this time i had gotten the impression that they had no interest in the situation in which they had left me and hung the phone up.  Phoned a plumber at a cost quite substancial to myself just for the call out, he cured the problem and explained it was probably caused by the british gas engineer turning my water pressure back on to fast, causing the fitting to blow. I am absolutely disgusted by the attitudes of both the engineer that visited my property, and the person i spoke to on the phone afterwards, and shocked they would leave me without running water.

Two letters confirmed our direct debit had been set up on 16 April for gas and electricity although there was no way to tell which was which. Two weeks ago received a reminder stating that we hadn't paid anything since we moved in so logged into account and set up the direct debit again. Now receive another letter threatening us with disconnection.Spoke to call centre somewhere in the world over terrible quality VOIP call and told direct debit was set up. Asked why this had all happened and was left on hold for 15 minutes whilst trying to connect to billing department.For a company the size of British Gas, how can they have such terrible customer service processes?

5,"            I don't know about other aspects of British Gas and I they are not my energy supplier, but I have had a Homecare 400 contract for many years now and I have used the services for gas, electrics and plumbing on a number of occasions.  The guys who deal with the first two have all been excellent, well trained, hard working, helpful and informative.  Now that you can book appointments online it is very easy to book a time that it is convenient.  Homecare is excellent and very good value in my view.When I first took out a contract plumbing was done in house but that ended some time ago. Since then my experience of  the plumbing side has not been so good.  The Dynorod booking system involves speaking to people who are not so well trained and can be rude and offhand and unhelpful.  Clearly the standards are different and probably British Gas has little influence or input to that side of the Homecare setup.  However, with one exception I have found that the guys who come out are cheerful and helpful.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to bring the plumbing booking up to the same standard as the rest.

The only disadvantage was lack of a phone call to say he was on his way - as our address was incorrect on the job paperwork the original engineer could not find our flat but did not phone our contact number so the appointment had to be rearranged. However this was done at our convenience. Be warned - check the address details on your service contract.

When i finally was able to take time they didn't do full homecare service sending an engineer out how could only do the boiler and not the cooker as well. this means that i will have to take even more time off work - which in these straitened times is precious resource. overall i find them poor

2,"            Hot water not kicking in until taps on quite high which means water not getting a hot as it normally does. Hot water no it kicking in at all on the basin tap. Engineer decided that the water pressure in the basin tap was not good enough. I tried to explain that it had been working fine the day before with the pressure the same but he would not listen just saying the pressure was too low.  I have since found a reducer in the basin tap and removed it. The pressure is now very good, but still you have to have the tap on nearly full to activate the boiler, so tepid water.  will have to send for an engineer again hoping it's not the same bloke.

I have checked on comparison sites on Google, and find I could get  the same cover as a new customer with British Gas for £9.50 plus an excess. I could also get much cheaper cover from other companies. I have just rung B.G. and been told that these prices are for new customers only, and that I have no cause to complain, so I have cancelled my contract. I feel a £45 per year rise in price is excessive, and I stress to everybody reading this to make sure you check your renewal quotes.

What a brilliant service! I have often thought about moving to another provider just to reduce the amount I pay, but for all the other benefits that go with British Gas, I've stayed loyal to them.

I phoned on Monday to arrange an appointment for the breakdown and book my annual service (as this was also due) . I was given a 5 hour window on Tuesday afternoon. I told the customer service advisor that unless it was after 4pm it would be a wasted visit for the engineer. The advisor out this in the notes. The engineer arrived at 1pm to find no one in.I phoned on Tuesday night and was given a slot between 4-6pm on Wednesday for the breakdown and annual service . The engineer arrived at 4.05 but unfortunately my wife was delayed in traffic so missed them.I phoned on Wednesday night and was given a slot between 4-6pm on Friday for the breakdown and annual service . The engineer arrived at 3.02pm to find no one in.I phoned late Friday afternoon and was given a slot this morning for the breakdown and annual service. The engineer arrived this morning to fix breakdown only. He resolved the problem.I then went online to book the annual service. I am unable to do so as the system still believed I have an outstanding booking, even although the engineer left 20 minutes ago. I then phoned to book the annual service - I was offered from Tuesday  in 5 hour slots. I told advisor this was not suitable as we were at work and asked if we could have a 2 hour window - I was told this was not possible. I was offered to be transferred to the online team to resolve my problem. I said yes but when was transferred I got an automated response saying that there was planned maintenance this weekend , therefore the system was down.Hopefully you will understand my frustration at trying to book an annual service.  Incidentally on my initial call l I was offered the option of adding electrical items onto my homecare product - I told them I would wait until my annual service visit and breakdown visits were successfully completed before deciding. Given my experience  can you explain why I should consider adding to my homecare.

4,"            Four appointments with three different engineers of different levels of experience, each with different findings. Would have been better to have one engineer work on the problem. Had to stay in four mornings as a consequence, which was very inconvenient.

5,"            Annual service from British Gas is great - the engineers always know their stuff, they're as quick as they can be and very efficient, always friendly and give advice when needed.  Very good service.
        ",2014-08-05T21:11:43.000+00:00
5,"            For the first time ever I received a letter regarding the annual inspection which is now back to its original date in July as it lapsed rather badly over the last few years.  The service slipped back  sipped back to October last year. With the new arrangement  It was easy to make my own appointment by the internet with the follow up by British Gas to make sure my appointment was confirmed. this was excellent on this occasion. In the past I have always had to ring to make an appointment as I was never contacted by British Gas as far as my memory is concerned

4,"            I had British Gas visit as my radiators where coming on every time anyone had a shower.  The engineer was very helpful despite being subjected to the noise of all my children.  He knew straight away what the fault was and carried out a difficult repair.

3,"            I booked the engineer on the web site. He turned up at the time expected but said the problem was not his and we needed a different engineer. He booked the correct engineer but we had to wait in the rest of the day for the second visit.The web site made no provision for a small explanation of what the problem was and only asked did you have hot water, did you have heating otherwise the fault was classed as 'Other'.
        ",2014-08-05T10:14:49.000+00:00
5,"            Very convenient + easy to book service appointment online. Engineer was cheery and efficient. Painless.
        ",2014-08-05T10:12:30.000+00:00
4,"            The repair to or dishwasher was originally done over a week ago (28th July)  and then it did not work on the first go. However after a second wait of a week for the appointments to be made the repair to the machine and our washing machine was made and all seems very good and the engineer couldn't have been more helpful or polite.  If I had to be critical I would say that a week is too long to wait for a repair when you have been paid already and that if subsequent to a repair it still doesn't work then a priority appointment should be made.
        ",2014-08-05T09:14:33.000+00:00
4,"            The engineer arrived at the start of the window he had given me. He carried out the service promptly and efficiently. He  was very polite and made no mess.
        ",2014-08-05T08:04:33.000+00:00
5,"            The visit from the call to say the engineer would be at my home in about 15 minutes was efficient and my boiler and gas fire were serviced with no problems. The engineer was friendly and polite willing to explain what he was doing.
        ",2014-08-05T07:45:29.000+00:00

        ",2014-08-05T07:23:12.000+00:00
3,"            The Home Emergency cover is a useful tool, however it is very costly with British Gas considering a 30 minute annual check, IF a call out is not required. It must be pointed out that call outs are at EXTRA cost!Other companies carry out similar services at much lower rates. Bear in mind that each year the cost increases by more than one pound per month and this occurs each year whether a call out has been used or not!
        ",2014-08-05T07:21:05.000+00:00

5,"            The engineer called and advised his arrival time, the service was carried out quickly and professionally.  Advice given, exactly the same as previous years, so they must be right.  Worth paying for the contract to give me peace of mind for my boiler to keep going.

1,"            Well what a complete and utter mess up the past 4 days have been. For the last 3 months we have been informing British Gas about the fact that we have had no hot water - it would warm up but disappear immediately. We had numerous cowboys disguised as British Gas engineers come out. My absolute favourite was the comment from one who informed us that as we had been leaving our kitchen tap off in the hot water position - all the hot water was escaping?????? Yes you read that right! I laughed at the time. I had also been telling each cowboy who came that we had suddenly inherited under floor heating in our kitchen - it turned out that our hot water pipe was leaking. So we get yet another cowboy who digs up half the floor - makes some excuse that our external  water mains are blocked and we have to get the water board out. Bear in mind, during most of the time the cowboy was here - he spent the majority of the time planning the weekend with his mates. He goes off promising to 'come back'. The water board turn up within the hour - but cowboy Joe is getting ready for the weekend - he doesn't care that we have half the kitchen floor dug up with water coming through - even though we have a six month old baby and goes on into the sunset. He calls and says he will be back on Monday at 8am. Monday at 8am comes and goes - nothing. By 9.30 I call the head cowboys at their main wigwam and told he has been double booked. I have no idea when they were going to let me know. Despite being told that the job will take six hours - he will come back at 3.00pm. I asked them how I was supposed to feed my child and bath her as he would be here until 9.00pm!!!!!To cut a long story short, the cowboy came back - apparently fixed the leak - I have a hole in the floor which is bigger than my six month old and now have no hot water. He also lost the washer to my tap down the waste disposal unit - that was pleasant fishing that out of the muck and they are refusing to come back out until tomorrow morning at 8.00am!!!!! To say that I am absolutely and completely peed off is an understatement!!!!!!!!!!!
        ",2014-08-04T21:05:32.000+00:00
5,"            Went online to book appointment as my dishwasher had broke down and can't be without it it's like not having the washing machine, could not believe it when I saw an appointment was available for the same day, booked it and yes the engineer turned up, to be honest I thought I would get a call to say he wasn't coming, he had to order the part but the dishwasher was up and running 2 days later how's that for service and didn't cost a penny as I have the plan with British gas.
        ",2014-08-04T20:38:37.000+00:00
5,"            Fantastic service and their website is very easy to use.
        ",2014-08-04T19:59:16.000+00:00
4,"            Booking process was difficult, kept going on the website trying to book a slot and there were none left!! Was told to keep checking back but in the mean time I kept receiving reminders to book my service?! When the engineer was finished he recommended hive thermostat, if we wanted to change. However, the quote that arrived stated that it was work that I needed doing. This is not the case. This is very misleading and for some customers would cause them great concern. I think you reword some of your letters?
        ",2014-08-04T19:53:54.000+00:00
2,"            Having booked my annual boiler service the engineer turner up with no introduction or showing of proof of identity , on entering the premise he was rude from beginning to end his customer relations needs attention, when he did leave he left me without a working boiler , which i must add was working perfectly before. The next day we had another engineer come to fix it who couldn't have been nicer, he was polite and told me exactly what he was doing and that he will get it fixed. Is there any way I can refuse to have the fist engineer come to the house again, all I have on the paper work is the name ' Neil '
        ",2014-08-04T19:53:27.000+00:00

        ",2014-08-04T19:46:25.000+00:00
5,"            The British gas fitters are always really nice, they let us know when they are coming, they explain exactly what they are doing and ensure that our heating and hot water are working and if there is a problem they ensure we understand exactly what the difficulty is
        ",2014-08-04T19:45:19.000+00:00

        ",2014-08-04T19:22:17.000+00:00
5,"            As close to perfect as it is possible to get.They just did what they are paid to do, and that is excellent in my opinion.Well done.
        ",2014-08-04T19:10:34.000+00:00
3,"            Reasons for above:Engineer saw I was working on a tablet and asked if I was interested in Hive.  He went on to explain benefits to which I said they did not work for me as there was someone in the house 24/7 and as such, I was not interested.  A few days later I received a quote for ""required work"".  This is verging on mis-selling.2 the setting on my boiler was left turned up at maximum when I never need to have it above 3.  Could have been an error by engineer but collectively, I not entirely convinced.3 Water timer is set for 1 hour, 2 days after service, I noticed my system was working way past 1 hour then found the timer had been changed to 2 hours.Finally this should have been an annual service and this service was instructed at your request only 6 months after the last one.  When I asked engineer, his response was they were very quiet at present and trying to drum up some business.All told, not too sure what motives for all these points were but each one was capable of taking money out of my pocket and into yours.
        ",2014-08-04T19:08:47.000+00:00
5,"            My engineer was named Matthew. He was the best engineer to visit my house for a very long time. He was pleasant and polite as well as efficient and conscientious. I just wish I could book him personally to do all my gas work. He gave the whole system a good check and any questions I had he explained in laymans language. I felt complete confidence after he had left that my system had been given it's best overhaul ever.

        ",2014-08-04T18:45:58.000+00:00
3,"            The service was superb when the engineer finally attended. The process was marred by the failure for the engineer to attend the scheduled appointment and it took over 5 days for the fault to be rectified. Resulting in not being able to wash clothes for almost a week.
        ",2014-08-04T18:45:34.000+00:00
4,"            The British Gas man arrived as planned to service the boiler. He was friendly and started work immediately. I took him on trust and assume he carried out a first class service. I informed him before he left that a drop in system pressure was occurring when the system had been switched off. (Holidays)He told me to keep an eye on it. If the drop in pressure reoccurred, I was to either ring BG or book an engineer online.
        ",2014-08-04T18:43:55.000+00:00
5,"            BG service contract has been a good investment with a series of visits to fix an elusive fault.  Fast response with well trained technicians.  Hopefully now fixed.

After all if I had reneged on my payments they would have refused to do the service wouldn't they and rightly so.  It's no good complaining because they always have an unbelievable excuse ready. I think they have a reference book of excuses.

4,"            I have had a British Gas service contract for 25 or more years spanning 12 different houses. In that time there have been some engineers that cant help but criticise something about my home that has nothing to do with the gas or the servicing of the boiler. Over the years I have received comments on how I have my lounge furniture set out; where the electricity meter is positioned; how the repair to my roof should have been carried out; and way too many comments on EU standards and how I fall short of them.I remember a time when I would make the engineer a cup of tea and have a little chat about the weather, perhaps the children and we would wave a cheery goodbye and the whole exchange would have been less confrontational.

Engineers always tuen up on time and they send text reminders. I think fuel prices are comparable with others, I would take overall service into account if we were thinking of looking for a new provider.

5,"            I have never switched my gas supplier, why would I.  I use their fixed rate tariffs and review it at regular intervals.  I am confident i am with the best. I had my boiler installed by them and have a service contract on it.  They are there every year to service it and maintain it keeps on working reliably 365 days of the year. Another part of my central heating system played up a few years ago, this was down to a particular fault with the manufacture.  British Gas were there quick as a flash! replaced the part, it played up again so they replaced the part with a different manufacturers part, Sorted. I usually see the same two engineers, so I know them and this makes me feel not only safe to let them in, but that they know my system & how it works.  Top marks, would recommend to anyone.

4,"            I think sometimes the problems encountered by the engineer are difficult to resolve. We have no control over what previous jobs he has to attend to. But on arriving a bit late he serviced my boiler in no time at all. Very friendly engineer and also I was not at all put out by the slight delay.

2,"            I was due my annual service on my gas fire and gas boiler, which was booked for during July.   Now I pay almost £65 a month for this service and for peace of mind should I need any repairs.In the past I have had no problems with the standard of service I have received from the service engineer, however, this year the level of service was practically zero.In the past the engineer has taken my gas fire to pieces, cleaned it, using vacuum cleaners and brushes, gas pressure checked and also checked that the flu was clear.   This year the coals were removed from the fire and it was turned on to see if it lit, didn't see the engineer check the pressure, however he did check to see the flu was clear.   On replacing the coals on the fire he broke the grate that the coals sit on, and he didn't even say!   No brushes or vacuum cleaners were to be seen.   The job normally took the engineer around half an hour to fully complete, this time 10 minutes!  He then went upstairs to the boiler, don't know what he did there as I wasn't present in the room, however on previous visits the engineer ran the water and tested all the radiators were warming up and there were no leaks.   This engineer returned back down stairs around 20 minutes late to say that he was finished and then handed me the completed service form.   No radiators were checked.As I say I pay £65 per month, and this was definitely not the level of service I was expecting.Can't fault the manners or conduct of the engineer as he was pleasant enough.

Anyone can offer savings in the first year and then put up all the prices in the second to recover any saving we may have received in the first year. Why bother, when we have received consistently good service and value from BG?If it aint broke don't try to fix it. So we remain very satisfied customers of British Gas!

3,"            Having booked an annual service for my boiler, the service engineer arrived as requested. He noted some damp staining and made me aware of this. As the boiler is 15 years-old, he suggested I should get a carbon monoxide detector, which he duly fetched from his van. He then informed me that he would request a second opinion: a second visit at a cost of £50, which I duly paid. I was then given another invoice for the carbon monoxide detector. As this second visit was his recommendation, and no fault of my own, I believe - as did the second engineer - that this charge was quite unfair. The 2nd engineer did mark it down as a complaint on her record, though I haven't heard anything further from British Gas. Overall, less impressed than in the past. Surely safety measures like CO detectors should be provided gratis for older boilers - I'm sure it's within the company's vast budget. I will be getting a new boiler soon, but I am much less likely to choose one supplied by British Gas now.

I phoned to complain about him, and what happened next is beyond a joke. A man in customer service told me to hold on while he put me through to his boss in Scotland ( headquarters I was told). The so called boss just listened to me and said oh I'll speak to him. A few days later my husband phoned to find out what had happened only to find out that there was no  record of the complaint.. My husband asked for the manager to get in touch. The following day a lady phoned and said she was the boss and after hearing my complaint, she said sorry, but anywhere engineers are not allowed to take their shoes off because of health and safety and that was it. She didn't sound like she even cared. They are a bunch of liars and customer service is none existent in that company. It makes me wonder if she was even a manager!!

1,"            British gas are the worst company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Where do I start? Firstly they messed up the meter numbers in my apartment block and tried to bill me for someone else's gas. Fine, it happens. They then managed to create 3 different accounts for me, all for different meters and tried to bill me for all of them. I phoned up (I don't have a land line) and explained the situation after what seemed like an age of being on hold. They assured me they would correct the fault. 1 month later they send me more bills for incorrect accounts. I phoned again, interacted via email to ensure a paper trail and was again assured that it would be fixed. Another month later and I have debt collectors at my front door to collect for the phantom accounts. It's worth noting at this point that my actual meter was paid in full. More emails, telephone calls and I am again assured by two different staff members that the matter is finally resolved (probably taking a hit to my credit rating due to their incompetence). Received unwanted phone calls asking me to allow a direct debit to be set up with my account to which I replied absolutely not I didn't trust them and would pay my bills manually over the internet.Just this month I received a bill saying I have used £527 of electricity in just over one month (normal usage about £50pm). They read the wrong meter because the address on the account on their system is wrong. Despite the fact they have sent me in excess of 20 letters over the last year for various accounts I do not own.Gas and electricity is expensive - I have no one to blame except myself for my continued headaches regarding british gas. Do not use them.

The bills are in your name, so we want our money from you and they've started chasing me to pay. It is all started when we got a letter from the National Grid, saying that the records shows our gas metere is old and they will come to check and inspect it. We had to schedule an appointment when the hairdresser is open to get access to our meters which are in the basement and accissible only through the hairdresser!When the engineer came, he report that the hairdresser has a fake (submeter) and has never pay a bill before. He showed us that they are taking a link from our meter to use in their hairdresser during the day and flat in the night. This was happenning continuously for the last 20 months since they open the hairdresser. When we called the British Gas with the National Grid engineer presence and he talked with them as well, they did nothing. Simply, they ignored everything happened and started to ask us to pay the £16670 bill for a three month consumption of the gas. We are two adults and a child who are away from home all day for work and study and nursery, how it comes that we consume this much? British Gas just does not care!

Fast forward to today 23rd July 2014 there was a ring on our door bell who could that be it was a happy man(NOT) from G4S to guess what to read our gas meter after i managed to stop laughing i think a bit of pee came out i told him that it had been removed and was there any commuaication between the two companies there was no reply the only question he asked was it capped, i said no could not see the flame coming out of the roof after i said that he walked off.     These two companies get no stars from me.

1,"            I had an appointment from British Gas to fit a car electric charging point. No visit, no telephone call and no email message was received by me to advise of any problems to explain their non appearance. I had another appointment from British Gas for the following week and yet again no visit, no telephone call and no email message was received to explain another wasted day waiting for the installation. On both occasions, I telephoned their customer service number and I was guaranteed that the installation would be made on the promised days. How can I claim compensation for having to stay away from work for two days without any explanation  from British Gas? I am of the opinion that the £50 paid by me for part of the installation should be refunded to me as a gesture of good will by British Gas!

1,"            I've had a similar experience to so many others on here. I really just can't believe how bad the service has been.  I recently moved house and straight away switched energy supplier so was only with British Gas for one month whilst the switch took place. It was a month too long! So problem 1 - they added on some arrears to my first bill even though they knew I was a new customer. So how can I have arrears?! I bought the house from my Dad and know for an absolute fact he paid the final bill in full. Problem 2 -  The gas was completely off during the month I was with British Gas. They accept that I have used no gas but still keep sending me a gas bill for £183.59 and they have appointed a debt collector to hassle me too. I challenged this and they said I would get a revised proper final gas bill just covering the daily standing charge (around £6) and the debt collectors would be called off. A month later I get another bill for £183.59 and another demanding letter from a debt collector. I phone again. They say oh yes we have already called off the debt collectors and you will get a revised gas bill. You said that a month ago!!I find myself wondering if they do it on purpose in the hope that you will just pay the made up bill to get rid of them and the stress of the debt collectors. I would stay well clear of them if you can.

1,"            We were with British Gas at our previous address. My husband is in the army and during our time at the previous address he was serving abroad. I thought the amounts we were being charged were excessive as i was living alone so i called several times to check our tariff. Very rude staff told me there was no better deal, a few times they refused to speak to me as my husbands name was also on the account, one woman said if there was a problem with my account i should get my husband to call them from Afghanistan!! Once my husband returned we moved house and our gas is included in our utilities so we closed the account with british gas. We then received a letter to say our account with them was over £400 in credit, so appears we were being overcharged after all!!I hoped a call would mean we would get this refunded but was very wrong. I have made several calls and each time been told a different thing, first i was told there was a system error and they didnt know how much my last bill should be, the woman i spoke to just kept repeating that i need to tell them the amount my last bill should be as their system couldnt produce it!! Today i have been told they are waiting from a response from my new supplier, but they cannot give me a reason why this is or tell me how long it will take to be resolved. They just seem to want to make it as difficult as possible for us to get back the amount they have clearly overcharged. Each time i call i am not given a clear answer they just try to get me off the phone as quick as possible. Terrible service

1,"            We are a pub holding company who run a number of sites across the country for varying lengths of time. British Gas is the main supplier of 95% of these sites. The amount of time I spend trying to baby British Gas in order for them to get it right is down right ludicrous. When exiting a site, 9 times out of 10 we end up receiving an incorrect Final Bill. For most people receiving a final bill for £8000 would be distressing. Knowing British Gas' incompetence at billing this was queried with them, only to be told that had made a mistake and the final bill was actually only £1000.This isn't the first time this has happened, we also received a final bill for £16,000 when actually it was £4000 and most recently a bill for almost £40,000 which when queried (armed with meter reads to prove the bill was wrong) it turns out we actually only owed a meagre £301 as the final bill. These days when these types of bills come through, it does not cause me any stress as I know full well that British Gas are unable to calculate final bills correctly the first time. Also this week I received a final bill for a period in 2012, for a site we vacated in 2012 and was only generated and billed May 2014. However, I never received this bill but instead got a phone call chasing payment. When asked for a copy of the bill so I can check the figures (previous experiences dictating this is a must) I was threatened with the risk of a late payment charge. I fought back and told them under no circumstances would a late payment charge be accepted when it's taken them over 2 years to bill us in the first place.On the upside they do tend to answer the phone's quickly (never more than a 10 min wait so far) but the fact I even need to make these calls in the first place is atrocious.I am beginning to think I should receive a wage from British Gas for helping them correct their own mistakes every time we vacate a premises.

1,"            My wife and I recently purchased a school from a local authority with a view to converting into a house. Before we purchased it the buildings electricity supply had been physically disconnected. Not just switched off, the cables were sawn through. Since the purchase we started receiving bills from British Gas for electricity on a business tariff including a £27 standing charge per month for provision of the service. As you would imagine we contact them regularly to once again explain that there is no connection but to no avail. We still receive phone calls, a new bill each month and intimidatory chase up letters explaining how they will ruin our credit rating if we don't pay up. This situation has been ongoing since February.I am sure British Gas will try to get this post removed as well for not being a customer. Ironic really as I don't want to be one and it is they who insist that I am one. I am sure that the time taken to deal with this issue could be so much less than the time taken to falsely manipulate their ratings by challenging peoples honest feedback.Anyway in case they would like to check, my customer reference is A4289520.

Went throught survey and was waiting for material list to proceed (after numerous phone calls and e-mails but will give them that one) Then I got a phone call to say that they were really busy and my application had been cancelled!! I had to keep ringing to get another survey done. You keep speaking to someone different and they never had a date, then i go another phone call to say that they were not taking any applications further because they were only dealing with those without any heating; despite still advrtising. I was cross and to be honest let fly at the person who called. I then got a call to say that because of the problems they would continue with my application. Then another call to say they can't continue but would have to start agin and could I be in 'tomorrow' for a survey. As that was not possible they agreed to call back when they had Mays dates. I rang today because there had been no phone call  and they had no record of any call except to cancel! They can't ring after 5 which is difficult if you work. Nobody has any idea what anyone else has done and they don't seem to give a sh** that they are dealing with peoples lives1 Call themselves British!

1,"            Where to start?! I took over a company in Jan 2013. I agreed to a 3 year contract with British Gas the day I moved in. The company name was also changed. About 2 months later I had my first bill. Now, bear in mind I am a small garage whose last owner used approx £100 a month electricity. My bill came through for the first 1/4 for approx £12,000!!! I phoned up and spoke to one of their foreign call centres and this is where the trouble began. I naturally thought that I had read the meter incorrectly because it was a very old 1980's dial operated appliance. I read it again but said I couldn't be sure because the dial was inbetween numbers. I waited a week and a new bill came through....£11,000!! I phoned up again, understand that I had to explain everything all over again that took a good 20 minutes of painful checks and people stating the obvious, and tried to make them understand it was a rubbish old dial. They sent someone out. A week later I had another bill..it came to pretty much the same. They sent someone else out. Thankfully this person was an older chap who knew what he was doing. I had another bill that came to 1000's. After phoning up again I could not get them to understand that the were wrong. I was told that the person who opened up my new account and changed the business name had not done it properly so I wasn't getting charged the right rate and was put on an emergency tariff. So, they amended the bill again. It was still 1000's....Further discussions lead me to understand they had worked out my bill using an estimate from the last owner. The last owner had given an incorrect reading/s so this was a right mess. In the end I demanded a new meter and that it was s smart meter. months later and after a huge complaint the meter was fitted and guess what!!??......my electric bill works out at about £120 a month. They have used the first 1/4 against the 2nd 1/4 and made it an estimated bill - a fair compromise.I cannot tell you how frustrating this whole thing was and still is. The call centre staff are next to useless - I don't say this lightly. I can back up everything I have said and if they listened to their recordings they would also have no choice but to agree. I know their private customer services are a lot better. I don't know who runs their business department but they should be sacked.If you want to save yourself a load of hassle and stress go somewhere else.

1,"            i received a bill for from british gas for £42.90 a couple of days ago,so i sent them an email  to  point out that it must be a mistake because i am not a customer only electricity has ever been used in the property and it was not supplied by them,i received a reply explaining that it was for a standing charge and how rightfully they where to charge me under new ofgem regulations.i replied that i had no intention of paying as it was outrageous. i received a call  from a BG representative today and he pretty much just read off to me that they was in the right to charge me and a letter was sent out,i explained i never open any letters junk or otherwise from people i am not associated with.the representative also lied and said that they used to supply the electricity to the property,they did not as it was southern electricity previously.someone also must have made an account in my name without my consent when i contacted them as a courtesy to give them the meter reading because the reader could not enter the back yard.the representative worryingly also had knowledge of my date of birth,something i have never supplied them with. i have never been a british gas customer and i have no contract at all with BG to supply gas to the property,so can someone from BG quote what the law is that says i have to pay them for something on the property that is not used and is basically redundant,especially as i am not a customer and i also did request that they remove the meter years ago when i gave them the meter reading to stop the need for readings,but was told there was no need as someone would just continue to come and take readings every once in a while.the fact that they have left the meter where it is incurring them charges is not my fault,also the meter has property of onstream on it,so BG are trying to make charges for something that does not belong to them.perhaps i should charge them a daily storage charge for leaving their equipment on the property.did this alleged letter they sent out notifying ""customers""clearly state that the meter should be removed or capped to stop charges?.i have no intention of paying for a service i am not receiving or ever requested and im happy to go to court when the bailiffs get involved and i will contact every media outlet at the time for british gas to explain how they can justify making these charges to non customers. what worries me more is i live in an area that is probably 90% council properties,and of that 90%,over 90% are all electric only premises,so BG must have sent out many of these demands to old people who will just keep paying the charge.disgusting from british gas,if this is how they conduct themself by demanding money from non customers i cannot see how anyone would become a customer.

1,"            I could write a short novel on the problems I have had with British Gas. THEY ARE APPALLING. Metre readings seem to be randomly applied and then it takes MONTHS to get it changed correctly. Last time it took so long that they sent me a debt collectors threatening letter… despite it being THEIR FAULT that they didn't get their money because the bill was wrong every time (took 3 months to sort this out). Now I am in the same situation again as I moved and the property was with British Gas. And their customer service is APPALLING - they want to make me scream. It's so painful to have to speak to them or email them. It's like they are trained to make the calls as long as possible without resolving the problem. It's like they are taught to make the call go round and round in circles so that you'll just give in and give them the money (when you owe them less). On my most recent call (that lasted over 40 minutes of my time!!) for the third time the operator asked me the same question and I said: ""Didn't we go over this already? What was my answer 10 minutes ago??"" and she knew the answer. FInally I asked to speak to a manager oh but surprise surprise they are all in a meeting. I used to work in customer service and you ALWAYS had to have an on duty manager. Either they're at the pub or she was lying. THEY ARE HORRENDOUS and if they weren't selling an essential service, they should have gone bankrupt a long time ago. APPALLING BRITISH GAS SHAME ON YOU. Although now I am with [External Reference] and they are just about as crap. Spent 40 minutes setting up a new account and a direct debit and the direct debit was never set up… twice! And last bill is wrong and keep getting calls demanding money because they are incapable of reading the notes on my account that say the account is on hold because the bill has a mistake… Such incompetence.UPDATE: Well to be entirely fair to British Gas I thought I should add that after emailing the talktous email address, someone got in touch with me very quickly and the reason they suddenly re-issued these bills with different meter readings is because the developer that owned the properties before I took it over gave them these new incorrect meter readings at the beginning of the month. However, it is a shame that during my hour long conversation the other day with a British Gas telephone agent she was unable to tell me this information immediately (I did ask her several times where these meter readings came from) to avoid all this stress and confusion. ARGH!!! I would advise anyone with any kind of issue with British Gas to avoid customer services at all costs and just email talktous STRAIGHT AWAY!!!!

4,"            I've had full cover from British Gas for many years.In my experience I've had a very high standard of cover and care in terms of gas boiler, radiators, electrics, kitchen appliances and gas fires.........swift and efficient responses to all kinds of minor and major faults. Annual servicing has been very good.My only gripe is the woeful standard of plumbing and drains cover from Dynorod. My most recent experience left me feeling vulnerable, frightened and threatened in my own home by their intimidating and confrontational plumbing engineer.British Gas has been apologetic on the telephone and a small amount of money has been offered as compensation. I was promised a telephone call from a Senior Manager at Dynorod but that has yet to happen.I have been a loyal customer over many years and the breadth of my cover costs me almost £1000 a year. This recent serious incident has prompted me to consider looking elsewhere for similar amounts of cover. My decision rests on the response from Dynorod in the next day or two.If only Dynorod matched the high standards received from British Gas I would be a happier man.

I went with British Gas as their service and workmanship is meant to be of the highest standard, second to none and worth the high price tag (£3400) I did this through a credit plan so still paying for it and am now paying for my house to be destroyed apparently!1 year later and on to the third and worst problem so far. 2 taps already exploded in the last year, one of which they tried to bill me for after promising I wouldn't pay for the repair. Now it turns out a pipe they cut in the loft has been leaking for quite a while... right through the old airing cupboard in my kids room (""the new boiler will free up all this storage room for you!"") that was filled with my kids clothes, toys and the keepsakes I had kept from their first year and then continued down through the ceiling above the stairs which now has to be replaced.They were quick to respond to my complaint but that is the only good thing I can say for them. They sent a young chap out today who said despite admitting it's their pipe and their cap that failed and leaked, the installation was done ""correctly"" so I get NO COMPENSATION and NO DAMAGES... but it is ""very unfortunate""... ""Very unfortunate""!? I'm a single mother of 2, paying what will equal nearly 7k in total for a device that was originally bought partially to solve a leak in the tank just to be given another leak on a large scale that has ruined our home and its ""UNFORTUNATE!?"" How exactly does a pipe that leaks classify as correctly installed and not their fault!?What I wanted was the damage fixed and a refund on some of my labour. Instead I've been in tears since he left and now have the joy of several years saving to fix all the damage it has done whilst still paying for its cause.DO NOT GET A BOILER WITH THIS COMPANY!!!

Rude, obnoxious and gave the impression from the start of the call that she really didn't know what she was doing. When I asked her to double check the Meter Point Reference Number (which is a unique number assigned to a gas meter and to a specific address) even explaining to her that I was not patronising her, she then decided to go off on one and start arguing with me.

1,"            Many years ago, we had our properties' central heating systems covered by British Gas (can't remember what its called then) but when one of the boilers broke down during a very cold winter spell, the service was awful and after 3 months of wrangling, we had to get an independent engineer to solve the problem. Naturally we terminated all our service contracts with them.Anyway, we decided to give British Gas another go in 2012 and signed up one of our properties with them when they changed the boiler. In 2013, they did their usual landlord inspection and passed the system. However when the engineer came to inspect the system this year 2014, he failed the system quoting the pipes feeding the gas to the boiler is too small! When I contacted BG landlord team, I was told that the law has changed and therefore the pipes are now defunct and needs to be changed.Another visit had to be arranged and when the engineer came, he told my tenant that the system is working fine, can't see anything wrong with it. But he was not able to recertify the system and we have to call another engineer out to do that.I again contacted BG landlord team and according to their notes, apparently the engineer stated that my tenant told the engineer that I (the landlord) have instructed my tenant to refuse the engineer to assess the work! Obviously my tenant is furious because why would he had said that because he is not going to be paying for the repairs, I am, so why would he have refused the engineer to assess the repairs which after all is for his benefit and safety? Secondly, why would I have asked my tenant to refuse the engineer to assess the repair work when I have arranged the appointment and I need the certification. Thirdly, if my tenant did lied to the engineer, why would my tenant have allowed the engineer into the apartment to view the entire system in the first place? But the most important question is that my tenant is a high ranking civil servant within Whitehall and have been living in my property for over 6 years and I have not had any issues from him or about him from the other neighbours. Therefore base on my past experiences with British Gas and my tenant, I will vouch for the latter without any doubts whatsoever.When my tenant rang BG landlord team, he was told that the engineer who called is a ""casual"" whom BG contracts occasionally so he might have lied and they apologised to my tenant!Without much hesitation, I have cancelled my service contract with BG. I contacted an independent gas engineer company who says they have not heard about this ""change in pipe size"" claim as stated by BG. This company will be popping round to inspect my system for £40 plus £10 congestion charge fee which I will gladly pay as opposed to over £380 BG was going to charge me per annum for their ""hot air"" service. Should this private engineer company pass my system, I will update this review for obvious reasons to the benefit of all of us as consumers of these energy suppliers and I will pass this case over to the television watchdog programmes. I didn't realise cowboys exists in Europe!

3,"            A straightforward boiler exchange, old Glowworm hideaway for a new Worcester 24ri - with Hive - £2900. The quote lists items needed and individual part prices - everything is inflated pricewise from internet prices.Boiler £889 and horizontal flue £209.78 - BG-£1109 - Internet £840 inc delivery. Quoted for a plume kit that I don't want or need - £115.24 Internet £57.£1209 fitting, £196.93 to connect electrics, £196.84 specialist building work - So, a few bricks to close up the size of the old flue to the new one, £1200 doesn't include connecting electrics just screw to wall, connect flow/return and gas.How can they justify their charges?. Decided not to go with BG, my old boiler works perfectly fine so just having Hive fitted so I have better control of the boiler. BG rang me today to see if I was going ahead - I said No, they queried why, explained not a competitive quote, even charging me £50.78 to take the old boiler away - I said I will keep the old boiler - apparently that's not allowed - seems they take ownership of my property for free and charge me £50 for doing so - cheeky or what.The whole experience felt like dealing with a dodgy second-hand car salesman

1,"            14 months ago British Gas fitted a new Boiler, included in the cost (£2,910.06), was HomeCare 200. No problems there. Twelve months later we have a small problem with the divert valve. Again no real problem it turns out this is covered by the Homecare 200. However, since this was fitted we have had a problem with no having enough hot water! Again called out the Engineer under HomeCare. He states that we need a new Hot-water cylinder (£704), not happy but feel that maybe it is time to get a new cylinder. Engineer comes today to fit. However, after completing the fitting he then says that he will have to fit a new pump because the old one and the cold water feed are blocked due to sludge! This is 14 months after having a new boiler fitted. He then states that unless he agree to pay (£700) for a Power-flush British Gas would no longer honour the Warranties on any of our CH/HW system! Also we would not be covered by HomeCare which we have just renewed. When I asked if we could get someone else to do the work we again stated that unless British Gas completed the work again none of the Warranties would be honoured! (I do not know about you but I feel that this is extorting money  under threat)! When I ring British Gas Customer Service this afternoon asking how the system can be so full of sludge after only 14 months I cannot get an answer. The Commissioning Check-list for the new boiler stated that the system has been flushed and cleaned in accordance with BS7593 and boiler manufacturer's instruction, and that Fenox F3 was used to clean the system and Fenox F1 was used as an inhibitor only 14 months ago! For the last twenty years with the old boiler we never had a problem with sludge, British Gas comes into my home and now we have a major problem! I am still waiting for their Rapid Response Team (Ha Ha) to contact me, (has only been a few hours)!!!

Tuesday evening my Hive account suddenly showed signal strength of thermostat becoming weaker and over 30 minutes just lost it all together.  Called the 'geeksquad' technical support and they couldn't understand it.  They had me up and down stairs with smartplug, pressing buttons and switching things off and on.  After 45 mins they said 'nothing they could do, please call British Gas first thing in morning and ask for customer service.  Tell them I am unhappy with the system as it is continually breaking down.  Am asking for refund and for my system to be put back as it was.  Will keep you informed.Wednesday morninjg:  called customer service.  Very quick to answer.  Told them about previous trouble and tuesdays events.  They arranged a visit from engineer for that afternoon between 12 and 6pm.  At 1pm Geeksquad called and told me that BG had been in touch and problem would probably be due to radio interference.  Went through ritual of on, off, press here.  Eventually got it working again.  2pm Gas man arrived.  Told him about problem and he seemed very keen to fix it for good.  Checked all the system thoroughly and said he would install a complete new system next day.  Asked me what time would be convenient and off he went.Thursday:  system went down again in the morning.  1.30pm gas man arrived with new system and set about replacing the whole lot, keen to ensure it would behave properly for ever.  he even went away for 15mins to collect a component he thought would improve the system.  After over 2 hours the system was working properly and as yet no problems.  He even gave me direct contact number in case I had any more problems and assured me that if I was not happy I could have my money back and the original system refitted at no extra cost.A satisfied customer - eventually.

1,"            I'll keep this short as my experience is just too awful to write in full. If you are thinking of joining British Gas homecare for your boiler and central heating cover then in a word - DON'T. I joined a month ago and from the start they have been abominable. I have had to call out an engineer on 3 separate occasions in less than a month to fix the same problem (excessive drop in boiler pressure). None of the engineers have resolved the issue properly. But the worst part is their contact centre. Every time I call they can never find my account due to a supposed 'migration' of customer accounts to a new system, which seems to have been going on for a month since I joined.  I get passed between about 5 different advisers each time. They cannot find me - they tell me they will look into it and call me back within half an hour - they never call me back. I have to call  back and go through the same account rigmarole all over again with each adviser. You never speak to the same person twice. After all this nonsense they finally book an engineer (if I am lucky).  They tell me I will get a text confirmation message. I don't receive any message. I wait in all day - the engineer doesn't  arrive. I call to find out where the engineer is - they don't know. They cannot find any appointment booked in my name. I could go on, but it is just too depressing. Perhaps British Gas should spend their huge marketing budget on their internal systems and procedures instead of advertising incessantly for new customers on tv and radio, as they are clearly in a hopeless mess judging my experience and most of the other reviewers on here. They are by far the most infuriating and frustrating company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. When my Homecare agreement is finished I will not renew and will never call them or have anything to do with them ever again. Next time my boiler needs a service I will call any local company I can find - JUST ANYONE EXCEPT THE ATROCIOUS, TRULY APPALLING  BRITISH GAS.

Never had a problem, most of the time they have the parts in there van or they will get them for the next day. I have have several different engineers and every single one was polite and cared for the surroundings.

1,"            Joined British Gas Homecare and had a problem with my boiler in my flat. Had 7 appointments to my flat for a various BS engineers to fix a problem. Either the engineer didn't turn up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time, but didn't have the part and had to arrange another visit! Or he broke something else on his visit. My wife and I had to take days off work for this 'service'. We took so many days off from work sitting in the flat, waiting for an engineer to NOT turn up, that we weren't able to go on a holiday. Very unhappy - eventually I came to the end of my tether and cancelled the HomeCare. We never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced. After the nasty experience  we got a local engineer to come around and fix the problem the next day - should have done this in the first place. A very expensive and unpleasant experience.Don't believe the slick adverts and marketing. British Gas have the worst customer service in a company I have very come across. I will never use British Gas for anything again.

We have dual fuel (gas and electricity) and our bills have gone down quite a bit. We've found it easy to register for online billing and we submit our meter readings by text message. Recently they sent us a smart meter which hooks up to the electricity meter and tells us how much electricity we use at any time of the day and how much we are paying. It works....the kids are now switching the lights off, etc, in order to see the smiley face on the meter! This was a free service. Cannot recommend them highly enough and wanted to say so because it isn't often where I have come across such excellent customer service from an energy company before now.

1,"            So, I'm not one to usually go overboard on the exclamation marks, but if one person alone decides not to go with British Gas, whether their Homecare and electrical appliance cover (as reviewed here) or otherwise, well....So my house (which is rented to a lovely family) is (soon to be was) covered by British Gas Homecare 300 and kitchen Electrical Appliance cover for the Fridge freezer, washing machine and cooker.The problem started when the new tenant moved in, stating that the fridge wasn't very cold near the top. Not a problem I said, here's the number for the BG cover, if you arrange a time for an engineer to call it will be easily sorted, at no cost to you.Sounds straightforward! However...First visit - the engineer calls, takes a brief look over the fridge, tells them to defrost the freezer (it didn't need defrosting) and states its all fixed, thanks. Leaves. Nope, it wasn't fixed, and the food that the tenants bought based on his diagnosis was promptly ruined. Fantastic.Second visit - the engineer calls again, takes a look over the fridge and states that it needs turning down via the temp controls on the front. Again, states its fixed. Again, it is not fixed. Tenant again buys food, food is again ruined.Third visit - the engineer at this point decides that it needs a new fan and orders part.Fourth visit - engineer turns up to fit new fan, again says problem is fixed. Leaves. Problem is still not fixed and again my tenants food is ruined.Fifth visit - the engineer finally diagnoses a gas leak in the fridge and writes it off, saying it needs to be replaced completely. This now leaves my tenants with no way of keeping any fresh or frozen food. Not ideal with a family and young daughter.I ring British Gas to find out what the process is, turns out they will contribute 30% to the cost of a new Fridge Freezer but its via VOUCHERS and I have to use their supplier.I call the product replacement team to be told the cost of an equivalent spec fridge freezer is £900 (having only paid £450 for original one I find this ludicrous). I tell them not a chance, they'll need to find me something within a lower price range.I should mention that at this point, the current fridge freezer is within an alcove of certain dimensions, which would make things a little harder, but any standing fridge freezer will essentially fit as long as its not super tall.They called me back later in the day to say they couldn't find a suitable fridge freezer due to the dimensions required but they have referred it to a technical team, which could take up to 5 days. Remember - my tenant still has no fridge freezer at this point...I advise my tenants to purchase a temporary fridge freezer, which they do - this can be used as a spare in future when BG eventually pull their finger out.I am still awaiting a call back from both the product replacement team and the customer relations team as I have opened an official complaint and expecting compensation in the very least for my tenants and more towards the cost of the replacement fridge freezer.This has been going on for nearly six weeks now, and my tenants have been without a working fridge freezer for this long.Once this whole matter is closed, I will be cancelling the cover as its absolutely, shockingly bad customer service.Cliff notes:- Tenanted house- British Gas Homecare 300 and Kitchen appliance cover- Pay approximately £45 a month for this- Fridge Freezer both not keeping a low temperature- Engineers fail to diagnose problem several times and advise tenants its fixed- Tenants lose more than £300 of fresh and frozen food over the course of this whole debacle- Fridge Freezer is finally diagnosed as having gas leak and written off- BG product replacement is via vouchers and to 30% of the cost- BG fail to find replacement product and refer to technical team- Problem still unresolved after nearly six weeks and tenant has been without working fridge freezer for this timeSo as you can see, its not worth it. Take and spend your money elsewhere - I would rate them zero stars if I could.

2,"            I am glad to see that British Gas have had a satisfied customer who has recommended them.  Unfortunately, several encounters with British Gas over the last 2 decades years have proved less than easy and successful.The first encounter was to fit a new kitchen (from British Gas) - the completion of which was such poor workmanship that we made several approaches to customer services.  A letter from my husband to the Telegraph to protest about British Gas getting a 5* rating (yes - it was a while ago ... 1992/3) when they offered such poor service.  The letter was printed and then of courses we were fixed.  However - 20 years later, we were to discover not all was fixed....the indestructible corian work top was neither corian nor indestructible.  We gave up and got a complete refurb on the kitchen instead of a retirment cruise.The last encounter was their house assistance - having paid around £50 per month for emergency etc cover for the last 8-9 years.  We had a ceiling leak.  They had no workmen to send.  After 5 hours of trying (and our 11 phone calls to see what progress), British Gas then said you will have to get a local tradesman to do the work.  We did.  Homesense.  A real muck up and took weeks to get the money back which was, in the end, labelled a goodwill gesture.  We had all the pipes checked a relaid - bang went the plans for an alternative for the cruise.I am glad that one British company is making a profit, but certainly their customer services and trade credibility does not add up to ""the best"" for me.  NB we had an independant checker come to test our gas fires, one was condemned as giving out too much CO2.  This was annually reviewed under the British Gas contract, but it appeared not to have been done.If British Gas wish to come back to us on this long term overview, they are welcome......but not by phone - many many times we spoke to different people who were going to sort things out and when we tried to get back to them, no one knew who they were.Take care if using British Gas and TAKE NOTES of all said and done.xx

2,"            I've given them 2 stars - and it narrowly escaped being no stars - only because they did try to help - at least initially - but sadly did not succeed in solving my problem without my spending my own time, money and initiative to plug the big gaps left in their pitiful attempts at service. I had a British Gas Service Contract which included cover for an integrated fridge, washing machine and hob/oven - costing nearly £40 per month! Apart from a few boiler related calls over the years I didn't need to call them out until my Fridge stopped working. The first engineer came - just opened the fridge door - and said ""the compressor needs replaced"". He said it would take a few days to get and a week or so later a second engineer arrived with the compressor - but claimed the fridge was ""jammed solid"" and couldn't be taken out from under the work top to fit the compressor. He therefore declared it ""beyond economic repair"" and left.Later on my son and I had a look under the work top and found the fridge carcase was screwed on to brackets under the work top. Once we removed the screws we were able to slide the fridge out quite easily. We were going to contact British Gas and ask them to send the engineer back with the compressor he had with him the previous time. but we found on the web for this cost £177 - while a new fridge was only £160!  We told British Gas this and said we would prefer to go down the new fridge route and could we schedule an engineer to come back and fit the new fridge when it arrived. Things went quiet - no new appointment made. We fitted the new fridge ourselves (not rocket science)  and are still awaiting any compensation from British Gas. On reflection I would have been much cheaper putting this nearly £40 per month into a piggy bank and using small local companies to sort things out as and when needed. They would also come when I wanted them - no need to hang about for 5 or 6 hours waiting on them. BG will only give you a window from 08;00-13:00 or 12:00 -18:00 and won't ring you more than 10-15 minutes before arrival - so imposssible to go anywhere othe rthan the end of the street duruing all this time!
